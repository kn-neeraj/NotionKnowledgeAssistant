# Marketing Strategy

Article - "Marketing Myopia"

3 rules of marketing strategy

- Acquire profitable & loyal customers
- Retain profitable and loyal customers
- Let of of unprofitable customers

Everyone is market oriented with either - identifying needs or looking for latent needs

Price - easiest but more important factor in 4P (be careful)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Look for empirical & research evidence before taking any metric for face value of it

</aside>

### Lecture 2

- Don't make assumptions sitting anywhere, note down assumptions and see how it can be removed
- Look at the whole product lifecycle - purchase funnel, usage funnel, post purchase funnel
- Customers are predictably irrational - they derive experiential, functional, and social value from the product
- Look at the issue, and try to find the underlying causes. Once looked at all the multiple problems, figure out the underlying causes.  Then, figure out the possible solutions
- For products, perception is reality

Fashion Channel Case - Segmentation and Positioning strategy of TFC

TFC

- cable TV network- dedicated to Fashion - 24X7, advertising marketplace
- 80 M households. Women 35-54 were dominant segment
- Spend more on marketing, advertising..
- Revenue streams - advertising sales, cable affiliate fees

Wheeler's plans

- Frazier was saying they might need to drop advertising rates
- The key would be to target right viewers and offering advertisers an attractive mix of viewers
- TFC's advertising revenue model
    - advertising spots of 30/60 sec to consumer marketers
- Competition
    - $20B spent on advertising on various cable TV networks
    - Ad buyers were interested in ratings and demographics, and less interest in programming subjects
    - other fashion oriented programming for adv who wanted to participate in fashion programming
- Revenue growth
    - increased viewership (ratings), and (2) increased advertising
    pricing.
    - Attractive viewer groups - young women and men
- Competitive pressures
    - The study showed that TFC was facing additional competitive
    challenges in its attractiveness to cable affiliates. On a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the highest possible
    score), TFC had achieved a 3.8 rating on consumer interest in viewing, while the two competitors with
    new fashion programming had scored higher: CNN had scored 4.3 and Lifetime a 4.5 On awareness,
    TFC had scored 4.1 while CNN scored 4.6 and Lifetime a 4.5. On perceived value TFC was at 3.7, CNN
    4.1 and Lifetime 4.4.
- Consumer Segments
    - Fashionistas, Planners & Shoppers, Situationalists, and Basics.
    - **Issue** - a broad multi layered segmented approach and risk losing premium segment to other networks or focus on niche, profitable and potentially segment such as Fashionistas but then lead to drop in households or  number of viewers or target 2 segments - fashionistas and planners & shoppers,
    - or How do I improve good quantity of good quality viewership
- Exhibits
    - viewer demographics and competitor analysis
    - GFE national consumer survey
    - GFE survey - clusters
    - Ad Revenue Calculator
    - TFC Estimated financials
    

### Class discussion

- who is the customer and revenue generating options

    - end viewers
- How advertisers look at end customer - quality or demographics

- CNN - more buying power with cable affiliates
- end user survey
    - why this research? - understand the set of all factors related to the area
    - What kind of research - attitudinal + demographics = 4 clusters
    - timing not taken into account

- When you get data
    - Flat File Structure
        - Rows are **respondents**
        - columns - questions,variables,features,
        - Factor An - combining of columns (based on set of all questions - CSAT, demographics etc), dimensionality reduction
            - if I don't know which set of questions belong to a factor -  DS to do exploratory factor analysis - one of the techniques - PCA
        - clustering - combining of similar rows
            - discovered segments
            - basis of segmentation
            - technique of segmentation is critical because - garbage in garbage out
