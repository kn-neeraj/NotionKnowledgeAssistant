# Product Roadmaps

9 principles of excellent product roadmaps

- roadmaps should be myopic - max 6 months
- roadmaps should be up to date
- roadmaps should be simple in communication - no complicated charts!
- roadmaps should be non-exhaustive - roadmap is not a backlog
- roadmap timelines should be imprecise - roadmap is a guide, not a promise.
- roadmaps should be low
- roadmaps should display last they were updated
- roadmaps should display completed work
- should be accessible and consumable

**666 roadmap of Facebook**

- next 6 years - minds eye view of the world 6 years from now, plotting existing trends in a straight/exponential line in future
- next 6 months - when you look at what you will build within 6 months time you should see "making great progress" in the impact we intend to see. it is subjected to change
- next 6 weeks - very concrete. rolling timeline that is updated every week or two

Pick 2 or 3 important customer problems for this release. Any change to the product that doesn’t help solve one of those problems is eliminated from the backlog.

Roadmap requires deep and thorough customer insights

The best way to acquire these insights is through solid, constant user research. Product managers now need to initiate customer visits and observations, looking for what those customers truly need and what obstacles they face.
