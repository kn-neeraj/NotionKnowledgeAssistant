# Evaluate SaaS Products

ASP â†’ Average Selling Price

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ I usually look at the following : 
- Does the product provide a valuable service to its customers?
- Is the product-market fit in an attractive market? 
- Is the business model sustainable?
- Can they scale profitably? 
- What is the company/product worth?

</aside>

**Does the product provide a valuable service to its customers?**

It is a measure customer satisfaction and churn. 

**Customer Satisfaction :** 

- NPS - Overall customer experience
- Support CSAT - Support Experience
- Any other CX surveys/ratings

**Churn** : 

| Gross Churn | MRR lost in a given period / MRR at the start of the period |
| --- | --- |
| Net Churn (for existing customers) | (MRR lost from churn + MRR lost from downsells - MRR from upsells) . -ve churn means you are increasing total revenue from existing accounts. Opposite of this is Net Retention Rate |
| Logo Churn | Customers lost in a given period/ Customers at the beginning |
| Renewal Rate | What % of customers renew their when their contracts is up for renewal |

Are above metrics trending upwards in newer cohorts.

- Churn
- Upsells
- CX surveys/NPS

**Cohort** retention on metrics that matter.

**Usage - ??**

**Is the product-market fit in an attractive market?** 

- MRR/ARR growth
- Where is the growth coming from â†’ New MRR vs Expansion MRR
- New logos added
- Average Selling Price growth
- TAM (adressable)/ SAM (market you can acquire with your product) /SOM (obtainable market) is large
- Quick Ratio â†’ (New MRR + Expansion MRR)/ (churn MRR + contraction MRR)

**Is the business model sustainable?**

- Sales cost upfront but revenue are recognised over a period of time
- Profitability and cash generation
- Gross Profit (%) â†’ Low GP means a heavy services layer which is typically less scalable i.e. Revenue/Gross Profit

- Rule of 40% - *Growth rate + EBITDA margin > 40%. Growth rate is defined as yoy growth rate of monthly MRR*

**Can they scale profitably?** 

- Blended CAC â†’ S & M costs / # of new customers
- Paid CAC â†’
- CL â†’ 1/ customer churn %
- CLTV â†’ ARPA * gross margin (sales-cogs/sales) * CL
- Payback period : CAC / gross margin * ARPA (lifetime require to payback the amount)
- LTV/CAC ratio â†’ â‰¥3 ideally
- Rate of investment in growth â†’ S & M costs / Revenue
- Attachment rate â†’  ??

**What is the company worth?**

- ARR
- ARR growth rate
- GP or Gross income %
