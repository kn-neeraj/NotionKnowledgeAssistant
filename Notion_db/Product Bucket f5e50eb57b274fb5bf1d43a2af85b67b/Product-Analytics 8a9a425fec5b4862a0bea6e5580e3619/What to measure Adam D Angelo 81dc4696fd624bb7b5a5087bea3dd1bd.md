What to measure in products?

- How to know users are getting value today? Total usage :
    - Active users, Revenue, Transactions (marketplace)
- Cohort Wise Retention -
    - A cohort is a user who does first time in the product in a particular time window
    - What is happening to users over time? Successive cohorts should retain longer to prevent you run out of users!
    - There has to be a lower bound at minimum!
    - If usage of cohorts increase over time its great! (Strong network effects → as product gets bigger, is it kind of product that people use more)  Whatsapp, Uber, Facebook
- Growth : User growth, Revenue Growth
    - Measure even rate of growth per week
    - Products with Virality, WoM, bigger your product gets easier it is to get users!
- No. of iterations drive product improvements
    - How fast you are iterating!  → How long it takes from idea/code to product? (Quora has like 15min from code to production)
    - As companies get bigger there are forces that likes to put non-sense processes and decisions by committees led to more time for iterations!
- Metrics are measures of value! Focus on end user value and the metrics that are actual measures of value!
