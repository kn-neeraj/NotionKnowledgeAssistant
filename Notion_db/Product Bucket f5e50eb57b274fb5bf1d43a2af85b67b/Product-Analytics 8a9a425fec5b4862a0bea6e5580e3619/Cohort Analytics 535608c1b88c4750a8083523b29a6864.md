Cohorts are group of users shared by a common characteristic

Ex - Cohort by acquisition date - monthly cohorts who were acquired in Jan, Feb etc

 (could be daily, weekly, monthly cohorts)

Why do cohort analytics

- Understand how following changes-  product changes, campaigns, promotions etc impact user behaviour
- You can compare cohorts for
    - retention metrics
    - engagement metrics
    - conversion metrics

- Characteristics
    - cohort type - based on acquisition date
    - cohort size - weekly, monthly etc
    - date range - 6 weeks etc
    - metric - retention etc

Other Metrics you need can check with cohort analysis -

- Using cohort analysis to improve your user retention, where to start?
    - Acquisition cohorts -  identify where you are losing them (Doesn't answer why are they leaving)
    - Behavioral cohorts - Group users by the specific behaviors they have (or havenâ€™t) taken in your app (Ex - app launch, complete user profile, Add a friend, complete purchase etc)
        - see which actions have a positive or negative effect on retention
    - Combining Cohorts for Even Deeper Insights
