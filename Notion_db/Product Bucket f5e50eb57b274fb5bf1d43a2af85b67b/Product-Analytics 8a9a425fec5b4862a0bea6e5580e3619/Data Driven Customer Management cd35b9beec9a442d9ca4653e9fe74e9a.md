## Lecture - 3

RFM Analysis

Code your customer using Recency

- recent purchase date
- sort the database into quintiles
- Recency is a powerful predictor of the response

Code your customer using Frequency

- total number of times customer has made the purchase
- sort the database into quintiles
- Frequency is a powerful (but less than Recency) predictor of the response
- **Note** : Lower quintiles respond better because they are recent buyers and did not have a chance to get high in the frequency ladder

Code your customer using Monetary Amount

- total amount spent
- sort the database into quintiles
- Monetary is a powerful (but less than Recency and Frequency) predictor of the response
- Note: Money is powerful for big ticket items

Break even in DirectMarketing

- cost of promoting that test group = net profit from test group
- calculate the response rate we will need from the test group to break even
- BE = cost per piece /  net profit from a single sale

RFM for consumable product

When not to use RFM

- have proper customer contact strategy
