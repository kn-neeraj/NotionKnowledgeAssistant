### **How Retention powers acquisition**

- Retention drives acquisition loops
    - Depending on business models companies can have 1 or more acquisition look
        - Viral loop - More active users in the product means more referrals and more acquisition by referrals
        - UGC content loop - More created and indexed content, more acquisition, Dropbox for example- more links shared with people more organic acquisition
        - Paid marketing loop - more retention, more revenue, more money to spend on paid marketing campaigns
- Retention improved acquisition competitive muscle
    - With increased retention - LTV will increase for a cohort and keeping LTV:CAC ratio same, company can afford **higher CAC**,weed out competition from various acquisition channels by bidding higher
- Retention accelerates payback period (CAC payback period is the number of months it would take to recover CAC)
    - As retention improves a cohort returns CAC costs faster accelerating payback period
    

### How Retention powers monetization

- Longer retention leads to more monetization touch points
    - For any cohort any improvement in retention improves revenue earned from that cohort. It accumulates over later cohorts
    - Looking at other monetization models - subscription, freemium, transactional, advertising
    - A subscription model with increased retention to have more subscriptions out of the cohort which means more revenue and an increased LTV
    - transactional model - more transactions out of a cohort
    - Bottom up SaaS like Mailchimp - more conversions out of the cohort
- Increased engagement, correlates with longer retention
    - User that have deeper engagement correlates with longer retention which leads to more monetization touch points
- Increased engagement drives monetization models - more engaged users drives more revenue in most models
    - Example - Company 1 having 1 million DAUs, same retention as Company 2 having 2 million DAUs
        - If Company 1 has deeper engagement and has more visits per day per active user, it will have higher ad inventory than company 2
    - Example - transaction model like Uber, Caviar (food delivery)
        - If company has more engaged users i.e. more orders per week per active user, it will be able to monetize the cohort better
    - Example- in bottom up SaaS
        - More engagement means higher usage and higher subscriptions

**Retention could be the silent killer for startups**

- Retention tends to get deprioritised due to long time horizon
    - A company with weaker retention has its active users curve flattened over the years (needs long term horizon)
- Poor retention is easy to cover up
    - Assume you are following top line numbers of MAU but underneath DAU numbers are flattening!  (gets covered up)
- breadth (retention is good) but no depth (deeper engagement)
    - Take examples of companies who had similar acquisition and retention, company with deeper engagement had more monetization
