### Retention is the core: Step by step methodological approach

- Use Cases (Qualitative view)
    - Problem
    - Persona
    - Why
    - Alternative
    - Usage Frequency
- Measuring + Analyzing (Quant view)
    - Define a retention metric and analyze it
        - Example - Retention cohort percentage, 12 WOW retention for weekly cohorts, plot the average retention
- Engagement strategies to build the habit loop - Trigger, Action & Reward
- Activation Strategies  - The process of taking user from sign up to establishing a habit around the core value prop
    - It has various states
        - Signed up -
        - Setup Moment - user has done actions to setup for the core value prop
        - Aha Moment - user experienced the core value prop for the first time
        - Habit moment - user has established the habit around core value pop (next stage is engaged)
- Resurrection Strategies - regaining users who once had a habit
    - Dormant user could be 3 kinds
        - involuntary - user got engaged due to some reason that wasn't a conscious choice
        - Voluntary
            - Satisfied
            - Unsatisfied
    - Churned
    - Not Activated

### Retention is the output - Define and analyze the output to identify on which inputs to focus

- Define retention metric for your product
    - Look for answers for this question - "*How many customers remained active within a defined time period of signing up?*"
- Retention (output) = Activation, Engagement, Resurrection (input metrics)
- Risks of defining retention metric in going outside in growth model (defined above)
    - Chosing the frequency of retention metric wrong
    - Chosing wrong core action
    - Optimising for incorrect audience (Certain users are more important in growth model)

### Use cases (Problem, Persona, Why, Alternative, Frequency)

Answer - What is the natural usage behavior and pattern of my target audience around the core value of the product?

**Nature vs Nurture**

- Natural usage pattern of our target audience aroudn our core value prop
- Amplify and nurture those natural behaviors

To answer first build use case map

- Problem -  Define the problem in the words of your users
    - Ex Hubspot Sales - "I spend countless hours on inefficient activities like CRM data entry, manually following up on emails etc"
- Persona - Who is facing the problem
    - Ex Hubspot Sales - "Shaun, the sales rep mid size to large company"
- Why - What is the core motivation behind using your product to solve that problem
    - Ex Hubspot Sales - "I can automate these mundane sales activities which helps me close deals faster"
- What is the alternative way to solve the problem
    - Looking for substitutes and not direct competitors
    - <Alternative informs frequency hypothesis direction>
    
- What is the frequency in which they experience the problem and use alternative to solve that problem?

### Multiple Use Cases + Retention

- Products typically serve multiple use cases
- Match retention metric to use cases (specifically look for frequency)
- Simplify by focusing on the dominant use case
- Low natural frequency use cases need to be paired with high frequency use cases to keep in the top of the mind of the users (Ex - Zillow content, community real estate updates)
