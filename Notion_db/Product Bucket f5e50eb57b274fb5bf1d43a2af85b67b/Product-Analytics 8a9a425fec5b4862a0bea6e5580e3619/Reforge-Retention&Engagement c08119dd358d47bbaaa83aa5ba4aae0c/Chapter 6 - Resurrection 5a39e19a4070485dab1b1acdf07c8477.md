# Chapter 6 - Resurrection

- How to regain those that once had the habit
- We will call these users "dormant users". The user established the habit once upon a time and then become unengaged at some point
- There could be different reasons user could enter dormant state
    - Product might not have done what user wanted
    - user might have had a bad previous experience
    - product didn't work at some point
    - user might have signed up and forgotten about it
    - competitor might have given the user a better discount or experience so they switched...
- Resurrection opportunities are not as good as they seem  : lets see the arguments for resurrection and refute them:
    - Debunk: There's a huge pool of users
        - How many users are eligible for resurrection?
            - But a large portion of the users in this pool is people that have never even activated
            - There is around 30-60% users are lost in productivity apps before even the habit moment
            - Even when you look at B2B, most revenue churn comes from users that never established the usage habit around the product
            
            <aside>
            ðŸ’¡ The psychology is completely different between users that never established the habit versus those that DID establish the habit at some point but then became inactive at a later date. Don't confuse between "Non-Activate" and "Dormant" users.
            
            </aside>
            
            <aside>
            ðŸ’¡ Probability of resurrecting a user decays quickly with time. The probability of resurrecting them is less than the cost of that we incur that we might not even try
            
            </aside>
            
        - Question is : How many users are eligible for resurrection?
            - Remove the users who were never activated (or dropped out before habit moment) and churned users where cost outweight the the benefit to trying to resurrect them?
            
    - Debunk: We have a way to contact them
        - Lift = Users * Response_rate * Retained (usually low)
    - Debunk:We have nothing to lose
        - the approach of keep bugging users who are not lost interest in the product might translate into high costs, damage and frustration among our user base
        - Cost
            - Damage to your channels - unsucsribe, spam detection etc
            - Negative WOM - anger users who start not recommending your product
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ Resurrection therefore is low impact low probability and medium to high cost
    
    </aside>
    
    When is resurrection a good idea
    
    - After you have focused on activation and engagement
    - understand the true opportunity and cost
    - around naturally high psych time periods - focus on specific naturally high psych time periods and capitalize on them. For ex - holidays that might bring users back to your product
    
    ### Reasons why users were going dormant

### Resurrect Dormant users

- Dormant - user has established the habit, remained engaged and then became disengaged
- 2 Types
    - Voluntary - Users made a conscious choice not to engage with the product anymore
        - Voluntary users who were satisfied -
        - Voluntary users who were not satisfied -
    - Involuntary - Users that disengaged due to tsome reason that wasn't a conscious choice

### Involuntary dormant users

- There are at-risk users that are still slightly engaged in the product but at risk, because they show a declining state of enagement
- There are voluntary dormant users who are not visiting the product, they are not likely engaging in your existing notifications and have formed a mental decision
- In between - Involuntary dormant users <Can inser photo from 6.2 time - 0.34>
- 3 categories of involuntary reasons
    - Product issues - logged out, chrome extension didn't appear etc, logged out experience
    - Leaving -  Left the company, market or made some other change where they can no longer use the product
    - Payment - payment failure such as aexpired cc, limit reached or address changes etc There are 6 different payment strategies
        - Optimizing payment option
        - RE-trying cadence
        - Accoutn updater programs
        - Reducing restrictions
        - CC Processor Rotation
        - REcurring flags

### Voluntary Dormant Users

- voluntary dormant users, we see :
    - haven't been using the product
    - they are probably ignoring our notifications
    - they have probably already formed an opinion that they don't want to use the product
- To resurrect voluntary dormant users
    - The why : Why has the person gone dormant
        - The user received the value, but it's not a repeatable use case. Like Tinder
        - The product didn't do what users wanted it to do  - For example - product missed a feature or users think it's missing a feature
        - Product overpromised but underdelivered.
        - Users enter an unsustainable habit loop, so habit loop become a reasons to quit the product. Ex - facebook addiction
        - Pricing movement : The product becomes too expensive relative to alternatives
        - Competitor movement : where a competitor tries to lure users away, often with deep discount
    - The message - the message we will attack them with
        - message or offer that will change the user's mind? 4 category of offers
            - new news - new features, integrations, other product updates
            - new use case - we can try to get user resurrected to use the product for a different use case
            - discount or loyalty program - focus on repeast behaviour not one time behaviour to give time to re-establish the habit!
            - +psyche moment - moment generated by acitvity, time, or some other event. Ex - Classpass, Fitbit around new year when people take new resolutions!!
            - 
    - The timing - what is the right time to send the offer or message to the user
        - activity based - activity based on some action in the product by the user or some other user in their network
        - Timed - Timed sequence based off of date going dormant
        - Campaign  - Campaign driven by some outside even such as a holiday, new feature etc
    - The channel - 8 channels we had identified before
    - The reactivation experience - quickest path to re-establish the habit. , example - Pinterest - "*Not loving the pins we are seeing, rebuild the feed*
