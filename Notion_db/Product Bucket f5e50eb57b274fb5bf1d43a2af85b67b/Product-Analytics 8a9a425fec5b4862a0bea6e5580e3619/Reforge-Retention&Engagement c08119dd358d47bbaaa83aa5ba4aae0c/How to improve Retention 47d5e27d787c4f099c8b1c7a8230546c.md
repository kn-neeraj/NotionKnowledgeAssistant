**How to measure Retention?**

- Cohort Retention: What percentage of new users are still active X months/weeks/days later?
    - Cohort chart
    - Line charts
- Answer if
    - curve flattens?
    - Is retention increasing or decreasing over time (for later cohorts)?
    - Any unusual pattern with the cohort

### 1. Improve your product

improve the value you provide to users

- Solve the customer's problem 10X better
    - work backwards from ideal solution looks like
- Solve more problems
    - breadth of the problems solved
- Make your product cheaper
- Make it faster and more reliable
- Wait for network effects to kick in
- Sometimes wait for the environment to be ready
- Pivoting solving to a different problem

üí° In my experience, the real levers to improve retention dramatically are in the experience for new users.

### 2. Improve your onboarding

- Early users - 1-4 weeks of signup
- Manually onboard the new user - 1:1 onboarding strategy
- Make sure new users experience your value
    - Look at what most engaged users are using
    - Simpler free trial - get most at the top of the funnel

üí° ‚ÄúThe first principle we learned at Pinterest is that we should get people to the core product as fast as possible ‚Äî but not faster.‚Äù

- Increase the odds that your new users have a great time
    
    <aside>
    üí° The users of your product don‚Äôt want to make choices, especially when they are in the first mile. The default options you provide, like which tab they land on and pre-populating fields with suggested selections, make all the difference in pulling new users through the first mile.‚Äù
    
    </aside>
    
- Get more users through the flow
    - Reduce the friction, distractions, and increase motivation

### 3. Make it stickier

- Build habits
- Create incentives to come back - loyalty programs
- Sign annual plans
- Deeper integration
    - The more integrated your product is into a person life, or an organization‚Äôs workflow, the harder it is quit.

### 4. Catch users before they leave

- De-activation flow
- pause or snooze instead of cancel
- Give users incentive to stay
- As why they are leaving, offer a solution
- Remind users the value they will lose - "Like Facebook friends will miss you"
- Predict churn and avoid it

### 5. Remind users of the value

- be present at more places
- increase entry points

### 6. Bring users after they have gone

- ad-targeting, calls or SMS

### 7. Change your users

- These users can have little-to-no intent to purchase, or can simply be the wrong audience for your product.
