# Chapter 5: Activation

We see activation improvements manifest by shifting our retention curves up meaning we retain a greater percentage of a cohort for all future cohorts

**Activation is the process of getting the user to establish that habit for the first time.**

Activation Strategies are about how to build the habit with first time users. 

We need to consider two critical pieces of activation 

- Activation touches 100% of our acquired users. Every user you acquire is going to go through the activation experience within your product. Not 100% of the users will make it to the core competencies of the product
- "Your first impression is your last impression". Users should form great first impression about the product. That gives leverage for long term retention habits.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ It tends to influence this beginning part of the retention curve where we lose the most amount of users

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ We make improvements to our activation phase of our time period and of our user life cycle, we see our retention cohorts shift up. New cohort has higher retention percentage after "x" time periods

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ If the retention curve is flattens it means we are able to save certain percentage of the users. It is the foundation on which we can grow. Therefore, we can move to activation as it will be a high impact area

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ ACTIVATION IS NOT EQUAL TO SETUP COMPLETE. ACTIVATION IS TAKING USER ALL THE WAY FROM SIGNUP OR FIRST TOUCH POINT TO GET THEM TO ESTABLISH A HABIT AROUND YOUR CORE VALUE PROP

</aside>

Activation can be broken into

- Setup
- Aha
- Habit

### Activation_Habit moment

- It takes lot of work to build a habit, so we need to actually define a different type of product experience and marketing experience, so we can help our users establish the habit
- WE can take steps to build habits better and faster if we can understand the principles of establishing this habit

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ No habit = Bad retention curve

</aside>

- Habit Moment - The user has done the core action multiple times within some initial time period
    - Example - Pinterest - weekly active Repinners, Habit moment - user has pinned for 4 days out of the first 28 days
    - Example - HubSpot Sales Professional -Daily Active Users, Habit Moment - user who has tracked an email for 4 days out of the first 7 days
- **4 strategies to accelerate habit creation**
    - Manufactured loops
    - Environment Loops
    - Use Case Transition
    - Grand Exit

[Strategies to accelerate habit creation](Chapter%205%20Activation%208896a16ba26e45a7ac0e18cb74e372cf/Strategies%20to%20accelerate%20habit%20creation%204ff2203c6b84464db7842667baf59a46.csv)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ 4 strategies are not mutually exclusive, but increases friction. More strategies require more things during the activation experience. Therefore, chose one dominant strategy as your habit moment strategy. You want to define a manufactured loop or a different type of loop, get users into that loop, and then transition them, and layer on the supplemental env loops and other loops as part of the engagement

</aside>

### Activation_Aha Moment

- The user has done the core action for the first time within the natural use frequency of the use case (first day if daily or first week if weekly)
- The habit strategy and habit moment strategy inform the aha strategy. (Walk backwards). We are walking back to understand that experience and moment that we are trying to design for the aha moment

**Aha Experience Strategy has 4 diff pieces**

- Core action - The core action or behaviour that is the indication they've experienced the core value prop
- Warm Start - The experience that creates momentum towards that core action (no cold starts) (set user such that )
    - Example - SurveyMonkey - Takes role and job function data in setup and provide templates of popular surveys built by the companies or people with similar roles and jobs â†’ Aha moment of creating and sending your first survey
    - Example - Pinterest - starts you by asking some of your interests and show the customized feeds
- Supporting actions - supporting actions or user actions that help and guide the user toward the core actions
    - Example - SurveyMonkey - Core Action = Create Survey, Supporting Actions = Search + Templates leading to core action
- Empty States - The empty states of other features that lead back to the core action
    - Fill those dead ins with experiences that redirect people back to the core action so that we optimize them taking that action as a starting point
    - Ex - in Mailchimp if people navigate back to the report feature we would block out and prompt them to see a sample report or send a campaign, in order to enable reporting feature
    

### **Activation_Setup Moment**

- User had done the actions to set up for the core value proposition
    - The absolute must haves that the user needs to do to experience the aha moment and launch into the habit experience
    - Example - User has chosen five topics of interest within the first day
    - Example - User has installed the extension and tracked 3 emails
- 3 types of must-haves
    - User info. Variables like a company, cc, location preferences, or role
    - Permissions - Location, device permission for different loops or re-engagement strategies that we formed within the construction of our habit moment and aha moment experience
    - Social - do the others in the experience to get the value?
- Examples of few common experiences and patterns that you may wish to consider adding
    - People you may know - popular in social products
    - Topic Picker - Used by UGC sites - Quora, Pinterest, Houzz etc - types of topics, how many topics, activity in the topic
    - Templates - SurveyMonkey etc - what info leads to best template recommendation, frequency of the template use, pre-signup and other data to optimize this experiment and recommendation
    - Notifications - email, push
        - Understand when users have dropped out of this activation experience
        - Understand where users dropped out
        - send a specific notification that brings back into the experience

### Qualitative research in Activation

Example - Shaun Clowes (Metromile, former Atlassian)

- Activation is NOT getting the user just successfully login
- Retention = Who are the people most likely to use software MOM
    - What % people sign-up, What % of people survive 1st week  - have baselines
    - What are our key distinguishing features, what % of users are using it?, WHat is the correlation with retention?
    - Constant iteration of ideas of you will try - a very substantive of them won't working
    - True authentic retention will come from people loving your product or essentially engagement!!
