# Chapter 4-Engagement

Retention is an output metric = Activation, Engagement,  Resurrection are input metrics

Retention - How many users were active within a defined period (The question is were they active or not active)

Engagement - An activated user is using the product within the natural usage frequency. Engagement is a spectrum of depth of usage (How active were they?)

- Power Users - The segment of users with highest engagement
- Core Users - segment of users with medium engagement
- Casual Users - segment of users with lowest engagment
- At risk Users - direction of engagement is continuously decreasing signaling a higher probability of becoming dormant

**Activation -** Establishing the habit

**Engagement -**  habit is established

**Resurrection -** returning them to engaged state

**The basics of building habits**

- My life in Advertising and Scientific advertising
- Hooked
- The power of habit

**The organic Habit Loop**

- Trigger - The cue that inspires action
- Action - The core action we want user to take
- Reward - reward user gets in response to taking that action

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The goal is to get the user to establish the organic habit loop

</aside>

- Example - Zoom
    - Trigger - I need an easy way to have a meeting with people not physically there
    - Action - Host a zoom meeting
    - Reward - high quality audio-video, time saved, money saved
    

**Step1 :** **Define the organic habit loop for your product**

- Trigger - (Problem defines the organic trigger), organic trigger is informed by the problem definition of the use case that you are solving for
- Action - (this stems from core action that we defined as part of our retention metric). The action that proves that we are delivering the value to the user.
- Reward - The reward stems from the "why" (why did they chose us over the alternative).  Should be strong 'Why' - was it convenience, reliability etc etc

**Step2: Design strategies to reinforce organic habit loop**

- Manufactured -  Loops with triggers that are manufactured by product or marketing
- Environment - Loops with triggers that we insert into places and products user touches when the problem occurs

### Manufactured Habit Loops

- manufactured triggers can help accelerate habit creation

![Chapter%204-Engagement%20ab870c24aa074c11b420f80fa63a765a/manufactured_habit_loops.png](Chapter%204-Engagement%20ab870c24aa074c11b420f80fa63a765a/manufactured_habit_loops.png)

- Example - JIRA
    - Trigger - Any change on issue or card
    - Channel - Push notification, Email with summary of change
    - Action - Reply, comment or other action
    - Reward - Completion, social, information
    
- **Step 1: Identify types of manufacturing triggers - 5 types can be identified**
    - Time  - time based trigger, something that happens in response to taking an action, ex - HubSpot sending you performance of an email campaign after 24 hours
    - Location - trigger based on location. ex - Starbucks app which sends you notification when you are around a store
    - Change - triggers based on changes that happened to product. Ex - Google finance - stock that I am tracking dropped by 10%
    - Network - network or peer based like in Medium somebody commented, somebody in network posted etc
    - Programmatic - programmatic triggers. Ex - plugging phone and dropbox reminds to backup photos
- **Step2: Identify all the channels**
    - Email
    - Mobile
    - In product
    - Platform
    - Browser
    - Desktop
    - Paid Media
    - Direct Mail
- **Step3: What is the core action you want them to take**
    - Action is informed by the core action we defined in the retention metric
- **Step4:Reward**
    - Extrinsic Rewards - rewards like time (time saved), money saved etc
    - Intrinsic Rewards - rewards come from within, inbox zero, reaching a new level in the game etc
    - Social Rewards - social recognition through a post or a badge, getting a friend request, completion etc

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Even something as "congrats", can help increase effectiveness the next time the trigger emerges

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Remind them of the reward to increase effectiveness

</aside>

Examples - Stich Fix

- Trigger - time based trigger - every month you get new shipment of clothes,
- Channel - send you notification
- Action - bring back into the product to rate and feedback
- Reward - money saved, joy or surprise. Your feedback on items, reinforce that trigger because they are going to send you even more customised material and clothing

**CAUTION: Manufactured loops don't work if you can't influence the organic trigger**

- Example products like Zoom or Uber (you can't manufacture trigger to influence the organic trigger of having a meeting or riding) in that case you use Environment triggers

### Environment Habit Loops

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Manufactured habit loops do not work when you can't influence the organic trigger like in products like Zoom, Uber etc

</aside>

- Step 1: Identify the routine the user takes when "natural trigger" happens
    - Uncover things like when, where, who and what are they doing when "natural trigger" happens
        - Where
        - What
        - When
    - Example - Zoom
        - In the conference when you have start the meeting but people are not here
        - Email or Slack back and forth
        - Calendar - setting up the meeting
    - Example - Uber
        - In google maps planning a trip
        - Some outdoor event coming up like concert, flights etc
        - Near a public transportation hub etc
    - Example - HubSpot sales
        - Email
        - CRM
        - Customer website
- Step2: Environment trigger cues placed near or in the pathway where the organic trigger occurs
    - Zoom browser and calendar extension
    - Hubspot email extension
    - Uber's Gmaps integration, Uber signs on their cabs
    - Yelp has content trigger - whenever you are searching for a restaurant, their ads surface
    - Physical products like Nest need to leverage big box retails because they natural habit loop
- Step3: How to discover your environment loops
    - Qualitative research - when the organic trigger occurs what are all places, products, people user might tough or interact with
        - Create a prioritization matrix - product or place, frequency - Always, Sometimes, Rarely,
    - Build or Buy or Partner
        - Is there a way to build something via APIs, integrations or buy access via ads or in a closed platform is there a way to partner
    - Costs
        - It costs to put these environment triggers in path of natural triggers
            - Product development cost - extension etc
            - Dollars to partner
            - Added friction for user to download extension etc
    - From the prioritization matrix chose the product with high frequency and low costs

### Building an engagement strategy

- Define the organic habit loop. This is what we are trying to get them to establish
    - Example LinkedIn
        - Trigger - I need to stay connected with a person professionally
        - Action - Add to network
        - Reward - Social Connection
- To create this organic habit loop over time define the primary manufactured or environment loop
    - Example Linkedin
        - trigger is a new connection or possible people who you can connect with
        - Channel - email, push notification
        - Action - add a connection
        - Reward - Social connections
        - This sets up whole new set of triggers
- Think about supplemental loops around the core loop. Finding supplemental loops is about finding new triggers
    - Example Linkedin
        - job update connections
        - recommendation
        - skill endorsement
        - new messagee
