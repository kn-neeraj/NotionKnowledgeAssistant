# Unit Economics

Unit economics is the measure of the profitability of one unit of your product or service.

Units could be product or service, or customer - [https://medium.com/speroventures/a-crash-course-in-unit-economics-dont-learn-this-the-painful-way-3d6344d03e39](https://medium.com/speroventures/a-crash-course-in-unit-economics-dont-learn-this-the-painful-way-3d6344d03e39)

<aside>
üí° *To calculate unit economics, first determine the ‚Äúunit‚Äù you‚Äôre looking to measure. For a B2C company, you may wish to measure the profitability of a good/service, an order, or a customer. For a B2B company, you may wish to measure the profitability of a customer or even the efficiency of a sales rep.*

Example - Keaton Row - Stylists can create lookbooks and people can buy these designs which customers can buy

Profitability per order 

- Unit contribution margin = Unit Revenue - Unit variable cost
- Net Revenue  = $50 (affiliate revenue)
- Unit variable cost = $60 (cost of stylist to create lookbook and service)

Keaton Row changed the revenue side and became the retailer having Profitability per order +$60

**Next logical unit - Customer**

- LTV should always be a measure of profit, not revenue

LTV vs CAC

- Look at CAC per channel and see where you can acquire customers cheaper than their LTV. "*Find the wells and drill them dry*"
- Ideally LTV : CAC ratio > 3
- Look at your payback period and if it is too high then you might just bleed through the VC money
