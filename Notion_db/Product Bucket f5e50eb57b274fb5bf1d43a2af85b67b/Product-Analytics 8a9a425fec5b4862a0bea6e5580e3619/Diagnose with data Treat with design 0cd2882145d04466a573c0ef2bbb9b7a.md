Data and Intuition :  pairing of data with intuition that enables us to reach our greatest heights

- The beauty of data lies in providing objective, quantifiable information impossible to infer from conversations alone.

- Being data-informed means using data as a tool, and using intuition to regularly check that the tool is working as expected.
- Intuition also comes from spending time with user data
