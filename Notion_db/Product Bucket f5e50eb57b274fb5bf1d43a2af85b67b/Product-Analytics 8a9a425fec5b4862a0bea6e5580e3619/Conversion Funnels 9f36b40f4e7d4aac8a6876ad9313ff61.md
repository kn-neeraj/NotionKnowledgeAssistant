**Some errors to avoid**

- Focusing only on high drop-off points. Ex- drop off points are start of the funnel. But it wonâ€™t do your business any good to fix that hole if youâ€™re only going to lose them at the bottom of the funnel anyway. Get the users you have to convert and retain at a higher rate, and then ramp up marketing to add more users. Itâ€™s usually easier to fix smaller friction points for incremental gains
- High drop off means thereâ€™s something wrong with the user experience- Not necessarily, it could be attracting wrong kind of customer
