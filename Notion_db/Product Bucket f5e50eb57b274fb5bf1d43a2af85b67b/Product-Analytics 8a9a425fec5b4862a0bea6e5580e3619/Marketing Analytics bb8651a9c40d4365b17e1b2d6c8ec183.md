# Marketing Analytics

**Motivation**

- Humans are not rational!
- traditional conjoint does not take into account similarity effect (a new product very similar to another product being launched)
- A similar product could be a decoy to make other product look good - dominance effect
- Compromise effect - Becomes a good compromise and have better purchase likelihood

Few activities product people need to do - 

- understand the future of primary demand
- identify the competitor and understand differences
- understand decision making process for customers
- segment  customers and select one or more target segments
- construct and evaluate customized offerings for each segment
- communication
- distribution

## Understand the future of primary demand

- Bass model for durables
- forecasting from historical data
- estimating market potential by survey or chain ratio method

**Bass Model**

M : Market size, the eventual total number of adopters

N(t): # of new adopters in period t

A(t-1): # of customers who have already adopted until period t-1

R(t) : # of remaining customers who can potentially adopt in period t (M - A(t-1))

p : coefficient of innovation

q: coefficient of imitation / word of mouth

A(t-1) = N(1) + N(2) +...N(t-1)

R(t)  = M - A(t-1)

Assumptions

- organic adoption
- linearly dependent to how many people who have already adopted it
- price remained flat
- no competition

N(t) = [p + q A(t-1)/M] * R(t) 

        = Mp + (q-p)A(t-1) - q/M * [A(t-1)]^2

- p is low  - N(t) it takes more periods to peak
- q is low - N(t) lower peak
- p is low - A(t) takes time reach the peak in S curve
- q is low - A(t) flattens..

extensions of bass model

- repeat purchases
- annual vs quarterly - but difference between the two - continuous bass model
- generalized bass model - taking calendar time and substituting with adjusted time by incorporating marketing variables (price variation and advertising)
- multi generation products bass model -

- Decision making process of customers, preference measurement  - We want to know -
    - which attributes are important?
    - which attribute-levels are more preferred?
    - Explicit Response Approach - Ask for importance valuations directly (use simpler methods to eliminate features)
        - Rating scales
        - Kano Method
        - ...<check slides>
    - Rating Scale
        - Interpreting Scale Responses
    - Kano Method: Data collection - random questions
        - Two questions for each need: one positively framed and the other negatively framed
        - Prepare a matrix
    - Rank Ordering
        - Problem: I don't know what is the gap between 1 and 2
        - Cognitive Complexity: Lot of attributes to rank
            - have less attributes to rank
    - Max Diff Scaling
        - In each of the following set of items, please pick one item you consider MOST important and ONE item you consider least important
        - First order balance - one attribute is shown equal number of times across sets
        - Second Order balance - Algorithms provide the minimal number of sets
            - Items per set = I, optimally - 4 or 5
            - How many sets, C = desired number of times of coverage
            - A is the number of attributes
            - minimal number of sets =  (C * A) / I
            - optimally, C = 6
        - Still in ordinal scale : You can't tell how much one is more important than other
- Constant Sum Scale
- Pairwise partial profile choice probabilities - ratio scale

**Evaluate potential market offerings**

- Setting the pricing/monetization scheme
    - Construct all feasible candidate products made up of all combinations of the attribute and attribute levels. For each product P:
        - Compensatory model
            - 
        - 

**Compensatory and non-compensatory model**

3 ways of measuring preference parameters

- Maxdiff
- Conjoint
- Emperical methods
