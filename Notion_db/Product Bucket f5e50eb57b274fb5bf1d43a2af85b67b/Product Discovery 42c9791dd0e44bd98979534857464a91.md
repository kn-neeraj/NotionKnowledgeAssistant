# Product Discovery

## Types of Research

1. Foundational research - research that gives you some foundational insight and helps you understand the customer/market better.
2. Feature-driven research - helps you validate the WHY behind a feature delivery project.
3. Recurring research -  a subset of foundational research.

**Foundational Research**

- How users perceive your product in terms of <something>
- Difference between power users vs new users
- What all  the alternatives

<aside>
üí° Let these research take time.

</aside>

**Feature Research**

- It can be research that helps the PM validates the WHY behind a project with the help of a researcher.
- It can be a UT that helps you understand the gap of an existing feature and help you plan fixes.
- It can be research that helps you understand how users are using a new feature you launched and if it actually helped solve a customer problem.
- It can be a competitor analysis.
- Examples
    - Typical use cases for a feature?
    - What are the jobs the feature is not fulfilling at this point?
    - We user both qualitative as well as quantitative research for finding answers to the above.

<aside>
üí° you need to time-box them. Always make sure you run these projects with a tight deadline.

</aside>

**Recurring Research**

- Run as per a schedule
- ow you are performing when it comes to customer satisfaction,
- has your brand salience improved over the last month,
- customer feedback on your Playstore
- NPS or CSAT

## 4-step guide to product discovery

- Product discovery is about defining what to build to solve a customer problem and generate a positive business outcome
1. **Outline your discovery toolbox**
    - Techniques such as exploratory user interviews, data analytics, story mapping, and sacrificial prototyping.

<aside>
üí° We are looking at a solution - Valuable (customers and org), Usable by the customers & Feasible (tech)

</aside>

- Team needed - Business, user and technology expertise
- **Week of focused product discovery will include**
    - Create and maintain an evidence board
    - Talk to at-least 10 users, customers or other subject matter expertise this week
    - Try a type of experiment you have never your tried before
    - Conduct at-least one ideation/design sketching session your team
    - Express your current beliefs has a hypothesis statement
    - Create a learning backlog - an explicit list of risk, assumptions, and questions
    - Track your hypothesis changes
    - Kill at-least 1 idea
    - Break into pairs to work on several discovery tasks concurrently
- **Validated learning cycle**
    - Declare your hypothesis - beliefs about
        - Problems
        - Solutions
        - Outcome
        - impact
    - What you need to learn
        - Identify your risks, assumptions, and questions
    - Create a test plan
    - Run your test
    - Synthesize your results and update your hypothesis

**Create and maintain an evidence board**

- a board containing - hypotheses, problems, solutions, discovery tasks, interview notes

**Distilled hypothesis statement**s

- We believe that <customers or users> have <problem> and if we build/make <this solution> they will <measurable behaviour> resulting in <measurable user benefit>

or you could have

- Problem Hypotheses
    - User profiles or models
        - Identify user types - differences that make a difference in how they would use your solution
            - Goals, motivations,
            - place, time - environment
            - Collaborators
            - Personas
                - General info
                - Behaviour - Activities or work, frequency, Collaborators, Locations, Other tools, Alternatives
                - Motivations - pains, obstacles, rewards
    - challenges they face today
    - How do customers solve these problems today
- Solution Hypotheses
    - Solution sketches - ideate with your team
    - 

**Learning Backlog**

- List and rank
    - **Risks** - what might go wrong
    - **Assumptions** - What must be true
    - **Questions** - Questions that need to be answered

**2. Plan how every team member can contribute**

**3. Consider how to continually involve customers** 

- ask your customer success team for support, or consider setting up a lead user pool where customers sign up to

4**: Set your ways of working**

## Silicon Valley Product Group - Product Discovery

- First, you need to discover whether there are real users out there that want this product
- You need to discover a product solution to this problem that is usable, useful, and feasible.
- we need to figure out the right product, and then we have to build the product right.

**Product Discovery Plan**

- must be done for this project
- Rough timeframe
- What resources are needed

---

- Discovery Core Team: At the very minimum, the product discovery plan should identify the product manager, lead designer and lead engineer for this project, and then ensure that these people are available for the product discovery activities.
- Discovery Extended Team: Who will be supporting the core team? Do you expect to need the help of a visual designer? Prototyping assistance? A usability testing resource? A specific developer? Someone from QA? Someone from marketing?
- Key Stakeholders: Who must approve this project (who has ‚Äúveto power‚Äù)? Also this can include a list of just generally smart people that you think you should talk to about this project.
- Customer Development Plan: Will this project utilize a charter customer/user/application program? If so, who will be leading this? If not, who are the customers or users that you intend to validate your product ideas with?
- Key Risks: What are the key risks for this project and how to you intend to address them?
- User Research Tools: Does the project need to do some persona work? A review of the site and business analytics?
- User Testing Plan: How do you intend to test these product ideas on actual users? What is the preliminary testing schedule?
- Product Strategy/Vision: Does this area need a longer-term vision before the specific project can be defined?
- Required Level of Supporting Documentation: The core team should agree on what level of additional documentation is required for this particular project ‚Äì stories, use cases, test plans, etc.

**Product Discovery Team**

- Product  - useful
- Designer - interaction designer - usability
- Engineer - feasibility (innovations come from here)

- In particular, we need to agree on the specific problem we are intending to solve, which user or customers you‚Äôre solving that problem for, how will you know if you‚Äôve succeeded
- The second purpose is to identify the big risks that will need to be tackled during the discovery work
    - the customers actually want this particular problem solved
    - is our proposed solution good enough to get people to switch from what they have now?
    
    Financial risk ‚Äì can we afford this solution?
    
    ‚Äì Business development risk ‚Äì does this solution work for our partners?
    
    ‚Äì Marketing risk ‚Äì is this solution consistent with our brand?
    
    ‚Äì Sales risk ‚Äì is this solution compatible with our go to market strategy?
    
    ‚Äì Legal risk ‚Äì is this solution something we can legally actually do?
    
    ‚Äì Ethical risk ‚Äì is this solution something we should do?
