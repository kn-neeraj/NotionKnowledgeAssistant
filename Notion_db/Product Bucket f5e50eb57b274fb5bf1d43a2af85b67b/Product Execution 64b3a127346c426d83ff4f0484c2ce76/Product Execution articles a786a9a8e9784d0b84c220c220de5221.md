## Making good decisions as a PM

- Decisions are our job as we "the most context" in a company
- Important decisions a PM makes
    - Why a team exists (vision and impact they aspire to create)
    - What the general approach is to accomplish the vision (strategy)
    - What to build now, and what not to build (prioritization)
    - What is he smallest thing that can be built that achieves the impact (MVP)
- Right decisions
    1. Making decisions using the right amount of information
    2. Making decisions as quickly as possible
- The takeaway is that when the stakes are high, you should work a lot harder at making the right decision

**This framework breaks down decision importance into 4 dimensions:**

1. Resource investment from a decision  (Effort)- rate low to high
2. The overall impact of a positive outcome - large impact, incremental,....
3. The impacts of a negative outcome (shown more granularly to help you think it through, but the sub-dimensions could be different for you) - "what could be the impacts of a negative outcome" (brand and reputation of company, codebase, liability or other legal risks)
4. Easy to undo or not
