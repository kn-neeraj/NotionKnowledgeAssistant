# Generic concepts

### Graph QL

- GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime forÂ [application programming interfaces (APIs)](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-are-application-programming-interfaces) that prioritises giving clients exactly the data they request and no more.
- Developers can build APIs with whatever methods they prefer, and the GraphQL specification will ensure they function in predictable ways to clients.
- it can be introduced on top of any REST API and can work with existing API management tools

workflow

- Construct GraphQL query to ask data and fields in a specific format from the API
- GraphQL is open source and developed by Fb

**Earlier** 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Front end consumes data using REST API. Problems : 
- We may need multiple entities
- We may only want to a subset of entitites

</aside>

GRAPHQL â†’ Data is is queried using a syntax and shape in which frontend wants request

Server resolves such requests.

GraphQL syntax

- Query type
- Mutation type â†’ how data can be modified on the api

Developer consumers can use explorer to get all possible entities and data
