<aside>
üíÅ Evaluating Feature Adoption ‚Üí How severe is the problem in your target user base? ‚ÜíLow severity (Low adoption 30-40% of the target), Mid adoption - 50-60%, High adoption - 80%+

</aside>

**Limitations of Adoption**

- Adopting a feature doesn't mean that the use likes it or gets value out of it
- More adoption is not always the goal
- Adoption metrics can be easily aritificially inflated

## Feature Retention

<aside>
üíÅ Share of adopted users continuing to use the feature (how well your feature solves the problem for the user)

</aside>

**Measuring & improving** 

- **Determine natural use frequency**
    - Frequency in which the user experiences the problem the feature is intended to solve (Typically Feature natural frequency < Product natural frequency)
- **Measure retention curves**
    - Measure retention curve
- Analyze results
    - How do we know if it has feature retention?
        - If the retention curve never stablises ‚Üí then there is problem
        - Importance of feature to the product's value proposition ‚Üí (Example - messaging is critical but reminders are not critical)
            - High ‚Üí 50%+ of adopted
            - Medium  ‚Üí 25-35%
            - Low ‚Üí 10-20%
- Define Strategy - Why features have low retention?
    - **Feature is buggy** - customer tickets,
    - **Novelty features** - features whose value have diminishing returns (driven by transient virality)
    - **Feature Cannibalization** ‚Üí Feature successful
    - **Dud features** ‚Üí Feature don't solve the problem they intended to do!. Feature should be killed  ():
        - Feature is obsolete ‚Üí The problem that it solves is not important anymore
        - Redundant ‚Üí The problem the feature was designed to solve is being solved by another feature int he product
        - Incompatible ‚Üí Do not fit in your product bundle (collections in Quote copy of Pinterest)
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ Good product teams work with other teams like communications or marketing, to explain decisions and offer alternatives to existing users. (A/B test the removal of it)
    - Are there any significant complaints being made by users?
    - Are there changes in user behaviour indicating users are getting less value from a product
    - Are there any changes in business metrics indicating less ability to capture value from users?

    ## Feature Satisfaction
    
    NPS works better for product than features ‚Üí people don't recommend "features" but "product"
    
    - Measure CES (Customer Effort Secure) ‚Üí 96%  ‚Üí how easy was it to solve (your problem) after you used (feature) today?
        - Much easier than expected ‚Üí satisfied
        - Easier than expected ‚Üí satisfied
        - As expected - satisfied
        - more difficult than expected - Not Satisfied
        - Much more difficult than expected - Not Satisfied
        
        <aside>
        üíÅ First 3 means satisfied. Better to collect from retained users. Feedback is often best collected in product, as near to the feature experience as possible. Take user responses from the sample population
        
        </aside>
        
    
    **Feature Types**
    
    - Hidden Detractorrs ‚Üí Contributes to valuable part of your product but frustrates users with bad experience. Poorly designed but commonly used.
        - Improve, change or replace based onsatisfaction
    - **Core Value Drivers** ‚Üí **For high satisfying features**
        - Captures value effectively
        - Capture more value or expand target audience
    - Niche Features ‚Üí Add value to a particular user segment effectively
        - Maintain if important target segment, adds value to product, and not too costly

    ## Feature/Product Fit
    
    Post Product Market Fit ‚Üí 
    
    - Create new product value
    - Improve on the current product value
    - Growing the number of people who experience the current value of the product
    
    **Improve on the current product value**
    
    - Feature/Product fit ‚Üí
        - Feature has to retain users for that specific feature
        - Feature has to have a scalable way to drive its own adoption
        - Feature has  to improve core engagement, retention or monetization for the code product (they should make the whole product experience better)
        
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ The team on working on the feature is motivated by the feature usage & not product usage.  Making the product experience more complicated and distracts from the core features.
    
    </aside>
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ Your job is to find out if the feature has feature-product fit. You do that ‚Üí feature adoption, feature retention. How does this increase ‚Üí Product retention, engagements and monetization.
    
    </aside>
    
    - For which users the feature has feature/product fit. Some features should only target a small percentage of product users.
    
    **Common Mistakes**
    
    - Email your entire user base about new feature ‚Üí Users care about the value that you provide to them.
    - Put a banner at the top of the product for all users introducing the new feature
    - Launch with a lot of press about the new feature
    
    **Launch as an experiment**
    
    - Expose new feature to just enough people to determine if it can start passing your feature-product fit checklist
    - Start with ‚Üí Data analysis & user research
    
    **Feature-Product Fit Checklist**
    
    - What is the data telling about usage of the feature?
    - What are the users telling about the feature?
    - How can I use the core product (notification, incentives, people) to help driver adoption of the feature
    - Is the feature showing retention?
    - What type of user(s) is retaining usage of the feature?
    - How do I limit exposure to only those users?
    - Scalable adoption strategy
    - Feature driving ‚Üí Engagement, retention, or monetization
