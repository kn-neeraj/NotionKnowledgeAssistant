**Generalizable process to launch something into the world**

1. **Discover  -** 
    
    Given - Pretty open ended!!
    
    1. Goal - **Problem Definition**
    2. Mindset - explorer
    3. Questions
        1. General problem area
        2. Customer behaviour, goals, what job are they trying accomplish
        3. is there a problem worth looking into? or strategic opportunity for the company to sieze?
        4. What are users doing, how are they doing and why are they doing?
    - Techniques
        - open ended, qualitative nature of the problems
        - learning from users
    - Outcomes - Which problems are you going to solve and for whom
2. **Design** - 
    - Given - The problem you are trying to solve & for whom
    1. Goal - Solution Definition
    2. Questions
        1. Solution options
        2. which solution makes most sense
        3. which solution to focus our resources, which solution to build & what solution will look like
    3. Techinques
        1. interviews
        2. Design research
        3. Surveys
    4. Outcomes - 
3. **Develop** - 
    
    Given - Problem & prioritized solution approach
    
    1. Goal - Solution prototypes  â†’ make decision about their usability & readiness. For that we do validation (how usable it is, is it actually solving the problem ) under controlled environment
    2. Questions
        1. Prototypes readiness
        2. Validation of solution prototype in controlled setting
        3. Get feedback
        4. Iterations
    3. Outcome - The solution does work and you are confident that it is ready for broader audience beyond test group
4. **Deploy** 
    1. Goal - General availability & evaluate how it doing (Share the updated solution more broadly). Is this solving the problem & are people using it? & then **Decide** - Call complete, Adjust/Optimize or Abondon
    - Questions
        - How it performs in the real world
        - Is it achieving the goal?
        - Are people using it or not? Why or Why not?
        - Are their any barriers?
    - User surveys, A/B testing
    - 
5. **Iterate** - 
    1. Goal - Continuous learning & next best action
        1. Questions
            1. Is this solving the problem & people are using it or not
                1. Decide - complete
                2. Adjust/prioritize 
                3. Abondon
