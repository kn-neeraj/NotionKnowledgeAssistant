# Conversational Research

Qualitative && attitudinal insights from the user.

Prepare → Conduct → Debrief

## Preparing for Interviews

- Don’t jump without really knowing who the user is!
- Should take 25% of your time! → find better people, do better conversations!

2 things to plan

- Recruiting research participants → Plan, Source,
- Interview logistics → who, where, consent & compensation

Assign clear roles 

- Question askers
- Note takers

Consent

- like a relationship.. both parties should have something valuable
- platforms like consentkit

Compensation

- Some form of compensation helps!
- one-off (cash) vs potential long term (may end up taking part in advisory board, beta, panel) → gift, note

## Conducting great interviews

Common Mistakes

- Asking exactly the questions you want answered without translation
    - Instead of “Whats your mental model around grocery shopping” → How they grocery shop, budget, how do they know what to buy, etc
- Forgetting to build rapport and context before diving into the substantial questions
- Interviewer’s are like a hike we take together!!
    - Rapport → build → peak → wrap up
- **Rapport** → Make space for introductions, make some small to break ice, introduce the research & why you want to talk to them
- **Build** → Give more background on topic importance, signal any topic changes to participant
- **Peak** → Topics of interest
- **Wrap up** →  Thank participant for their time, heads up on next steps

Define Peaks based on evidence needs of the interview

- How do they think about...
- Deeper conversation on a few topics

<aside>
💁 Avoid leading questions that could bias the interview. Embrace “how” and “why”.

💁 Being ok with silence!! The power of silence!!

## Debriefing

- Debriefing as you go
- Updated understanding of evidence needs
- Implications for what comes next
- Debrief → Note interesting observations → Go a level deeper → contextualize responses → align on key learnings
- Outcomes → Do nothing (no change in interview process) or Stop interviews or adjust questions or adjust participants, adjust logistics
