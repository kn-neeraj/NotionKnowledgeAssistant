## Live Class

- Developer Productivity
- Performance
- Scaling

When you think of estimates think in terms of directionally correct → days, weeks, months, quarters, etc

Velocity → ship fast & being right

Company vision & strategy → product strategy → team goals or outcomes we want to achieve → "High impact projects" by the team focused on the outcome

"Explore their problem area" & just want to understand about you and the problem you are facing, and not here to convince you about something.
