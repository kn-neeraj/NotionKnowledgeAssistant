# Refine user value

4 key questions

- Who is the user
- What is the user problem  (severity, and alternatives)
- Why is it important to them and alternatives
- What does success look like to user and how will we measure it?

### User Value Map

- **User Profile** ‚Üí demographics, firmographics (company, role, size, industry), product behaviour
- **User Problem ‚Üí exact problem user experience, root cause of the issue ‚Üí Description, severity, Alternatives**
- User Goals (How to evaluate if feature solved the problem) ‚Üí qualitative, quantitative, & non-goals

User Value Map template ‚Üí [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v30hFtYeXkchhp9fk3oU3mTYMU0K4PCnQKE7R-mcZTs/edit#gid=1258839088](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v30hFtYeXkchhp9fk3oU3mTYMU0K4PCnQKE7R-mcZTs/edit#gid=1258839088)

### Methodology ‚Üí Best way is to engage directly with users

### Effective User Interviews

- Determine interview audience ‚Üí talk to most relevant users
- Recruiting the target audience you defined to speak with you
- Structuring the interview to gather the data needed to answer relevant questions
- Debriefing and synthesizing insights from the user interviews

### Determining your target audience

- Typical company user profile (this is the baseline ‚Üí which expands or find a subset of it)
- determine how target audience from your current project differs from the company user profile
- identify secondary attributes to add diversity project's target audience

### Recruiting Interviews

- Source ‚Üí If past users (use internal data), If non-users (use external data)
- Screen ‚Üí On an avg, you need ~6 people to talk to, (Email ‚Üí a short description of why you want to talk to them specifically, and a screener questionnaire.)
- Schedule ‚Üí Reach out to a random subset of those users, interview & then repeat them (staggered manner to provide you time to debrief & synthesize insight)

### Structuring the interview to gather the data needed to answer relevant questions

Effective user interview has 3 key objectives

- who they are, their profile, behaviour, motivations and relationship with product
- Problem in their own words‚Üí what is it, why it happens, why is it severe or not, what alternatives have they tried
- To explore more broadly are relevant to the user, relative severity or importance of this particular problem

<aside>
üíÅ User interviews are not about exploring solutions, you want to learn about the problem from user's perspective

</aside>

<aside>
üíÅ Pitfalls
- Don't spend enough time warming the user up and gathering foundational information about them
- Jumping straight to leading questions about problem hypothesis
- Focus too much on pre-written questions & miss opportunities to follow up on new info

</aside>

**Interview Trail Guide**

- The warm up ‚Üí Introductions, break the ice, introduce the research you are doing and why you want to speak with them, permission to record the conversation, no right or wrong answers here just exploring..., Some small talk ‚Üí how are you doing today...how is the day/city
- Build up ‚Üí Product behaviours of your target audience, general experience in their lives as it pertains to the product, questions about how they go about using product, why, when, etc...
- Peak phase ‚Üí go to **specific** questions about the problem hypotheses you have, what alternatives they use, what is their experience with the alternatives, if you could improve one aspect then...

### Debriefing and synthesizing insights from the user interviews

**Risks**

- Validation/invalidate hypotheses based on a small subset of memorable answers
- Generalize learnings that only apply to a subset of the population
- Miss patterns that would allow reaching deeper insights

### Debrief & Synthesize

### Debrief

- Happens after each interview. The most important insights immediately after each interview, while they are fresh in your mind.
- Document user profile - Who you spoke to and attributes they have from the target audience
- Document observations (about user problem & how user experiences them, how severe it is, what are the alternatives in front of them, goals they are trying to achieve when solving the problem) from the interview - Observations that support your hypothesis, Contradict the hypothesis, Introduce new hypothesis
- Extrapolate insights based on observations - Problem takeaways, Severity takeaways, Alternative takeaways
- Evaluate the interview process - Stay the course, adjust questions, stop interview

### Synthesize

- At the interview campaign : identify patterns & answer initial questions we set out to answer
- Cluster based on user problems ‚Üí Problems & cluster of users who face it
- Identify patterns across user profiles¬†‚Üí User profiles which face this problem (are specific user profiles facing specific problem, is any problem dominant across user profiles)
- Identify patterns across alternatives and severity ‚Üí Is severity, alternatives low/medium/high and different across user profiles
- Create a user value map by answering the 4 key questions  ‚Üí What are the user profiles, What are the problems they are facing, What is the severity and alternatives they have
- Revaluate the project based on conclusions  ‚Üí Add qualitative success criteria, quantitative success criteria & non-goals
