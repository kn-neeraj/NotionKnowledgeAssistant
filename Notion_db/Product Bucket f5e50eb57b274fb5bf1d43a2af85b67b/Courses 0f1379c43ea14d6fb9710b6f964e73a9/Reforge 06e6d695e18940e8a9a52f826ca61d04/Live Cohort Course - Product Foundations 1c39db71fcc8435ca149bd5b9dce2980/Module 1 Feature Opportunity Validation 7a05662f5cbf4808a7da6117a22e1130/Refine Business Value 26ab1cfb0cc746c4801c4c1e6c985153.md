- Verify the outcome is accurate and attainable
- Ensure the project net delivers a positive outcome
- Gain trust and credibility with your team

2 ways 

- A business metric is given to improve with baseline & target
- A business metric is given to improve without baseline & target (you need to define a target)

**Estimated project value using funnel analysis**

- Funnel analysis entails mapping and analyzing a series of events or actions that result in a specific goal or end point.
- Funnel has starting point & end point, how many users are completing each action and where users are dropping out most.

1. **Build a funnel**
    1. First define the target audience
    2. Starting point : The key action the target audience takes in order to enter the funnel
    3. Ending point : the key action the target audience takes that signifies that the user problem has been solved
    4. Intermediate steps : from start to end
    
    Broadly 3 types of funnels
    
    1. Sales Funnel ‚Üí prospect, lead, evaluation, free trial, .... acquired or converted
    2. Feature Funnel ‚Üí journey for a feature from awareness, adoption, engagement to retention (signs of habit formation)
    3. Growth Funnel ‚Üí  break down a user journey from starting to end point. 
2. **Calculate the problem magnitude**

    - Check the funnel drop and understand the problem magnitude to serve as the **baseline**
    
3. **Evaluate the potential business value**
    1. Determine the right proxy metrics
        1. Internal Proxies - metric from projects you have already run 
        2. External Proxies - Industry, other industry, stage of growth, business model  
    2. Use the proxy metric to determine the impact on your baseline i.e. by what % it will improve
