# Communicating Opportunities

<aside>
üíÅ Communicating insights to key stakeholders (leadership, project team, and other dependency teams) ensures you are aligned on the path forward.

</aside>

Risks of not communicating insights back

- Constant rework by other team members
- Late-stage blownups by leadership
- Dependency Teams deprioritizes the project (value the project brings to user & business)

2 types of meeting 

- Product Reviews - Get buy-ins & feedback
- Project updates - Project update meeting happens at the end of development stage with the goal of sharing progress & remained aligned before starting the next phase.
    - Feature Opportunity Validation stage, for example, you should connect with your design team to share the context and insights you have gained from engaging with users and with your manager about the problem you are solving.
    - At the end of Feature Design, you‚Äôll need to engage with your engineering team to share the solution you and the design team have agreed upon. With engineering, you could share the overall goals of the project and what‚Äôs in scope vs. out of scope to help them make prioritization
