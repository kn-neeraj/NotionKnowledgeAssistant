# Iterative Convergence

<aside>
üíÅ Convergence ‚Üí Narrowing potential solution ideas to single, well-defined working prototype!!

</aside>

**Phases**

- Prioritization
- Prototype testing

**Prioritization of ideas that were generated keeping user value in mind**

- Solution that are feasible & viable
- Viable ‚Üí Strategic fit & business value
- Feasible ‚Üí time, resources & tech constraint

**Constraints based prioritization**

- Cluster-level ‚Üí Can element clusters as a whole
- Within clusters ‚Üí Look within remaining clusters, eleminite that seem less viable/feasible
- Across clusters ‚Üí Prioritize those that are still left and satisfy the constraints

**End**

- A small set of solutions that we will need to test further with users via prototypes!

---

**Prototype testing**

- Create a prototype -
- Test with users - incorporate user preferences, feature is truly desirable to users, solve the problem in a delightful & differentiated way, early signals around key risk areas
- Improvise -

<aside>
üíÅ Solution ideas can be thought of broad ideas & design choices (workflow, UI/UX) i.e specifics!!

</aside>

**Establishing Objective of prototype testing**

**Exploratory Prototype testing - When we have to chose between multiple solution ideas** 

- 3 questions to answer
    - Of my solutions which ideas are more desirable
    - What design choices do user prefer more or less? UI/UX, workflow
    - Do users with different user profile ( demographic, firmographic & product behaviours) differ in what is desirable?

**Validation Prototype testing**

- Objective ‚Üí Validations of the prototype we have developed
- At this point we know what possible solution idea is desirable for the user for design decisions & any risks
- 2 questions to answer
    - Design decisions
    - Risks

<aside>
üíÅ Can use existing sources of insight : 
- User logs
- heatmaps & activity trackers (helpful in design choices about info architecture, and layouts of our surfaces)
- Direct feedback,  customer support tickets, 
- Spot surveys & polls

</aside>

4 things to keep in mind while testing prototypes

- Audience ‚Üí Test with the targeted audience
- Fidelity ‚Üí Chose the right level of prototypes.
- Test moderation ‚Üí Observe users interacting with the prototype, and draw conclusions from that.
    - Setup
    - Interaction
    - Q & A

---

### Executing Design Exploration Tests

- Which idea or parts of idea are more desirable
- what design choices do user prefer more?
- do users with different profiles differ in what they find desirable?

**Fidelity** ‚Üí  Typically low

**Moderation** ‚Üí talk about problems and alternatives in mind. Set the right tone, that we are looking for high level reaction to these concepts. what assumptions they should operate under, and exactly what they should focus on.

**Interaction** ‚Üí Card sorting (must-have, good-to-have, not-relevant) or simulated buying to uncover preferences 

<aside>
üíÅ Visit the "Design Methods" module of User Insights Program.

</aside>

**Q& A** ‚Üí which of these you are more likely to use? & why?, When do you think you might use it or not? why? 

<aside>
üíÅ User interaction with the prototypes should be the guiding point for Q&As to understand deeper preferences.

</aside>

**Synthesis** ‚Üí why the solution idea or design choices resonated better?

The **output** of this process would be a low-fidelity prototype of the solution architecture they want to implement. It would be annotated with insights from the user interviews.

**Validation-Focused Prototype testing**

Focused on

- Any design issues with the prioritised solution
- Areas of usability risk that need to be considered during feature development?

**Fidelity** 

- Fully interactive

**Moderation**

- Setup - Introduce user problem, and Hypothetical scenario
- Interaction - Goal trying to accomplish, interact while thinking out loud, what they expect certain screen to do, and react how they felt. "Think aloud testing"
- Q& A - 1) parts of the prototype where we have low confidence that there might be design issues, and specific things we observed, which are counterintuitive to our hypothesis

**Synthesize the outputs**

- Design issues uncovered ‚Üí
- Usability risks ‚Üí

Output of this process is final prototype with all the design issues resolved. Should annotate to call out areas of usability risk.
