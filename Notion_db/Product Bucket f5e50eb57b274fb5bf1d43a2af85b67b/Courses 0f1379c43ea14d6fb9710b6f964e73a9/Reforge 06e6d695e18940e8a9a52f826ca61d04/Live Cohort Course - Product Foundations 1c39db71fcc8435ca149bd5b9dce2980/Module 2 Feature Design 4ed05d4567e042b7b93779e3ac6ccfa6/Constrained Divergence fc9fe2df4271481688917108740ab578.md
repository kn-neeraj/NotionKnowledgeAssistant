# Constrained Divergence

## Defining Constraints

<aside>
💁 Solutions should meet 3 constraints → deliver value with users by solving functional problem & delight, deliver business value, & easier to implement.!!

</aside>

Put constraints in the brainstorming session upfront. 

**Constraints** → It makes a solution more realistic option to develop & deliver while creating value for user & business.

3 categories

- Valuable for the user
- Viable for the business
- Feasible

**Valuable for the user**

- Solve the functional problem for the user (bare minimum) (User value component)
- Do so in a differentiated way from current alternatives they currently have (a unique & delightful way)

**Functional Constraint**

- Work backwards from user's problem solved → Core functionalities that would get them there ()

**Differentiation Constraint**

- Based on alternative methods users employ to solve their problems
- If alternatives are not robust, lower-level differential constraints might be good enough!!
- If customer has strong alternatives come up with delight constraints → What might make a user feel great?, What do users love about the alternative used today?, What are the pain points of current alternatives that could be delightful in our app?

<aside>
💁 If alternatives are very robust, focus on the functional constraints and lower-level differential constraints.

</aside>

**Feasibility Constraint**

- Timeline
- Resources
- Technical capabilities

**Finally, consolidate all your constraints in 1 place**

### Constrained Brainstorming & Clustering Solutions

<aside>
💁 Brainstorming is the process of ideating possible solutions to address specific problems.

</aside>

1) Constrained Brainstorming

2) Clustering potential solutions

**Structuring Constraints**

- Develop generative constraints for brainstorming
- Conduct the brainstorming session

**Generative Questions**

- Focus the generative questions on the core questions functionalities and differentiation required.
- How might we <address the desirability constraint> for the user so that we <create the desired effect>?. Examples
    - How might we "display messages information" so that users use it regularly to interact with the guests using the mobile app?
    - How might we make we easier to find messaging feature so that hosts can find the information they need?

<aside>
💁 Tips 
- Focus on best possible experience for the users → Push the boundaries of best possible experience for users
- Focus on experience, not on solution → Don't be too prescriptive and anchor on solutions too early!!
- Combine & next similar constraints →

**Conduct Brainstorming Solutions**

Crazy 8s → 8 distinct solution ideas for each "how might we"

**Clustering SOlutions**

Possible ways to cluster → Surface Area, User Type, Funnel Stage

Other possible clustering of ideas.
