# Introduction

**Feature design is a journey from problem to solution. It‚Äôs the process of defining how we want to solve the user problem that our feature is intended to solve.**

The design process involves 3 phases

1. **Divergence** - Exploratory process of ideating and brainstorming various solution options 
2. **Convergence** - Refining solution to prototypes which undergo prioritization & validation process.
    - Early validation
        1. Prototypes are tested with users
        2. De-risk assumptions
        3. Refine prototypes
3. Share outputs with project stakeholders, which enables them to clear the path forward.

üíÅ First, as PMs, we aren‚Äôt always experts in coming up with solutions or designs. Our strength lies in being the link b/w user & internal stakeholders.

## Process

- Brainstorming with constraints (acting as guardrails)
    - Push teams to come up with multiple ways to solve the problem
    - Explain the constraints ‚Üí scope, resource, time, technical feasibility constraints
    - Process ‚Üí Define Constraints, Constrained brainstorming, Clustering solutions
- Iteratively converging on an idea by prototyping and validating & refining
- Gain approval and build alignment with the core & cross-functional team. Also share underlying principles, and thought processes that inform the prototypes.

### Constrained Divergence

- Defining constraints
- Constrained brainstorming
- Clustering solutions

**Defining constraints**

- Valuable, Feasible & Viable

**Constrained brainstorming**

- "How might we" - How might we <user problem>

**Cluster Solution**

- Based on themes of similarities & differences
- Options ‚Üí Surface area by impact in the product, User type, Funnel stage (what part of the funnel they improve)

## Iterative **Convergence**

- Constraints based prioritization - Find the list of valuable ideas that are feasible to build & viable for business to sell
- Prototype testing -
    - Exploration - explore ideas
    - Refinement - refine and take hard decisions
    - Validation  - validate internally & with users
- Key Assumptions & Potential Risks
- Do Reviews
- Complete Product Requirement Docs

### Build Alignment

**Project Kickoff**

- All team members have a shared understanding of the project before starting on feature development
- Every member should have necessary context to inform their work and decisions.
- Thorough understanding of the opportunity and the solution.
