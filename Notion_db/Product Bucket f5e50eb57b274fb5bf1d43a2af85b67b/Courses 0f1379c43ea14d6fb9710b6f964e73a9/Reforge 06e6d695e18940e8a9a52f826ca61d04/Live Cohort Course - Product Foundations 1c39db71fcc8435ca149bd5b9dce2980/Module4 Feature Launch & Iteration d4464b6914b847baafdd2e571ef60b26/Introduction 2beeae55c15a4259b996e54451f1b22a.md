# Introduction

**Feature Launch & Iteration**

- Activities that position your feature to a target audience
- Ensure users adopt it
- Determine what direction your feature is headed in next

<aside>
💁 Great PMs don’t just launch features and move on; they make iteration decisions, and walk away with new learnings about what worked and why.

**System of launching & iterating in 3 steps**

- **Launch coordination** → How & when you are ready to launch a feature
- **Performance Evaluation** → This step plans what metrics will be measured and how those metrics will be assessed to evaluate feature performance
- **Post-launch Communication** → This step plans what stakeholders will receive updates about the feature’s impact and performance, and how

### **Launch coordination**

- Encompasses the work that goes into putting a built feature into the hands of users
- Deliver value incrementally → Teams put 2 levers → population coverage & feature completeness
    - A increasingly more complete feature over time
    - A complete feature to more & more users over time
    

**Botched Launches**

- Feature is flawed
- Feature creates a different problem for the user
- Company is unprepared to support the feature post-launch (necessary infrastructure to support feature post launch)
- 

<aside>
💁 Keep in mind that when we talk about launching a feature and putting it into the hands of users, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the entire feature has been built or that all users gain access to the feature right away.

</aside>

### **Performance Evaluation**

- Qualitative & Quantitative data to understand how it fares on goals laid out in opportunity validation
- Common issues
    - Not thinking about how to measure success before launch
    - Not analyzing the right metrics. Ensure, you are measuring how features are creating value for the user!!
    - Reporting raw feature usage data without deriving a clear "so what". Provide clear takeaways!

    💁 Own the outcome end to end.

**Iteration Directions**

- Optimize
- Redesign
- Roll Back
- Move on

**Post-launch Communication** 

Objective - Closing the loop with stakeholders

- Post-launch communication is the storytelling work led by PMs to help stakeholders understand the impact of a recently launched feature
- Stakeholders to communicate
    - The team that worked on the feature
    - Cross-functional leaders
