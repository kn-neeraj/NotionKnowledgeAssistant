# Partial Rollout

Objectives/Goals: - Am I GA Ready? What will a happen if we release feature to all?
Benefits: - Last checkpoint to assess any risk before feature goes GA
- Still possibility to tweak the feature without impacting a large audience
Details: A subset of users from actual target audience
Limitations: - Require time & resources to build, recruit users, and manage feedback channels
t if some extra work is needed to support staged rollouts
- Increases time horizon of the launch of the feature and  the value it can provide to users
