# 1. Roles and responsibilities

**Index**

- Playbook for execution
- Introducing a PM's counterparts
- Leveraging a PM's counterparts

Feature Development - The process of executing on the feature which is already designed. 

<aside>
üíÅ Without execution you can not deliver value to the product, and other aspets of product are paralyzed.

</aside>

<aside>
üíÅ PMs need to be good at execution to move forward to strategic work.

</aside>

**Feature Execution Map** 

- Cross-Functional Dependency Management - Activities requiring support from cross-functional counterparts that need to occur before launch
- Preparation - Activities that take place before any actual development work occurs
- Execution - The structured approach to turning a design into a launch-ready feature
- Risk Management - Actions to manage risk and keep projects to track throughout feature development

### PM's Counterparts

4 major functional areas in tech companies

1. **Engg, Product & Design - develop& improve products**
    1. **Product** ‚Üí Who is the user?, what problem are they trying to solve?, Why does it matter to the user & to the company?
    2. **Design** ‚Üí How should we solve the problem keeping in mind needs & goals of our users? Does the designed solution provide a consistent experience across the overall product?, ensure the feature is implemented as proposed, address design issues that weren't captured by PRD, Support additional prototyping to validate UX, func, and visual appeal
    3. **Engineering -** on actually building the feature
        1. IC ‚Üí 
        2. Tech Lead ‚Üí Project lead. Looks after aarchitecture and engg. decisions
        3. EM ‚Üí People-focused: Manage IC engineers, directly responsible for their success
    4. GTM (S&M, Growth) - Getting products into the hands of the customer
        1. PMMs ‚Üí understand the target audience, crafting positioning and messaging, and maintaining visibility on the market's landscape. They train or provide enablement materials for sales team
        2. Too often, Pms approach Sales or Marketing to solicit support too close to feature launch. Make them aware so they know what features are in development will pay dividends
    5. **G&A** (legal, finance, etc) ‚Üí Could be needed ‚Üí like legal, compliance, team
    6. **Ops** - Customer success & customer support teams
        1. Tell them in advance so they can prepare common responses.

### Leveraging the PM's counterparts

<aside>
üíÅ Turn uncertainity to certainity as a PM.

</aside>

**Cross Functional Dependency Management (IMPORTANT)**

- Ownership - Product Manager
- Create response macros for Ops teams (Customer Support, Customer Success)
- Syncing Marketing with PR Dates - Align with GTM teams (Sales & Marketing) for key marketing dates
- Syncing with other admin teams - (Legal, compliance)

**Preparation**

- **Defining Milestones** - smaller chunks of work to be completed sequentially to deliver the project.
    - Evaluating Risk ‚Üí can find the feature (discoverable), can users use the feature( usable), Does the feature solve the problem? (Valuable?)
    - Prompt value delivery
    - Sequencing work apt.

<aside>
üí° Ensure delivering value as soon as possible

</aside>

How to distinguish the target users from non-target users?  ‚Üí user self-select the journey to discover the feature

Feature usability ‚Üí friction in using

Feature value ‚Üí Put in the hands of users (population coverage (private beta, full audience if minimal downsides), feature completeness (leading indicators that are directionally aligned with output metric such as NPS)

**Dependencies** - Input task-output task, integrations, 3rd party req., resources, dates 

- **Writing Technical Specifications** - Tech spec (Should cover prototypes and the feature scope). PMs should be able to explain the ideal behaviour of the solution, and edge cases that should be covered.
- **Estimation** - "Costing" the project in terms of the resources, whether that be the time or headcount, needed to complete the deliverable. Evaluate the impact the project will have on the goals vs the cost it will take to achieve.
- **Staffing** - Done by EMs

**Execution**

- **Sprint kickoff** - EMs & Product Leads. Convenes EPD team, and covers the project, task prioritization, task assignments and alignment on commitments
- **Build Phase** - Engg. Be in sync to resolve blockers and track progress
- Sprint Retro - Retro what went well, what didn't and how the team can operate better in the future

**Risk Management**

- Ownership ‚Üí PMs

<aside>
üíÅ What do PMs own? ‚Üí Defining Milestones (PM), Running the execution Cycle (Execution), Managing Risk (Risk Management)
