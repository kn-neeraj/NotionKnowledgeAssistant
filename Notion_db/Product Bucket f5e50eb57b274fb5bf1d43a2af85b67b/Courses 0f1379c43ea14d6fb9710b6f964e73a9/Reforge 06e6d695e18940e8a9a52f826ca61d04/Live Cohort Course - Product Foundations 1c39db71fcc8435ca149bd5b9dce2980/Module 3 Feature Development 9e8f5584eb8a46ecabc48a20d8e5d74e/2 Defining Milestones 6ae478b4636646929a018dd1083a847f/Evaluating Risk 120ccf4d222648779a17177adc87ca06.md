# Evaluating Risk

<aside>
💁 Risk is anything that undermines the outcome of your projects.

</aside>

**Risks**

- Discoverability? (Can users find the feature)
- Usability? (Can users adopt & continously use the feature )
- Utility (Valuable?) → Does it actually solve intended user problem

### Discoverability

- When the features lives in within the large product experience, users need to be awareness of the feature in order to navigate to it.

2 kind of projects have such risks

**Feature that targets only a segment**

- Figure out how to distinguish target from non-target users →
- Let target users self-select into a journey that enables experiencing the feature →

**How will the features be discovered now vs in future?**

<aside>
💁 Notifications don't count because they help ONLY EXISTING users discover the feature and not the future ones.

</aside>

Solutions

- Put in the somewhere prominent so users can discover
- Product Onboarding that walks through new features within the UI

Account for this risk early → 

- You can put "Coming Soon" & see how many users discover the feature
- Enabling self-selection, Planning for continuous promotions, Embedding tool tips, or other UX solutions.

---

### Usability

- Think about when designing the solution where usability questions came?
- Tracing the user's journey within the product experience → Septs that can create friction
    - Physical Friction → Work needed to accomplish something.
    - Cognitive Friction → Asking user to chose multiple options, interpret undefined terms or concepts, complete calculations

**How to account for this risk?**

- Usability testing
- Early beta
- A or B test

### Utility (Value)

- How good the feature is solving the intended user problem & created intended business value.

**How to account for this risk?**

- Population Coverage → Subset of target audience you will roll out the feature to. Beta groups, Early Access program
- Feature Completeness → Test some, not all components of the feature.  Don't need to build everything & test at once

**Quality solution for the business**

- Business Value → "activatation increased by 5%",etc
- Look at the business value metric
- Don't make any of the core metrics worse
- Get early indicators. For NPS → "Quick user feedback within product",
- Ensure to check the second order or downstream metrics don't become worse
