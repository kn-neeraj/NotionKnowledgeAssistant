**Manage Stakeholder Communications and eliminate bottlenecks.** 

- Know how to communicate information at the right level of detail
- Remove the bottlenecks quickly enough, especially when the bottleneck is PM itself
- Gather intel about the status of their projects → PMs establish touchpoints, when its time for input & creating channels for sharing information
- Standup meetings can be used to create regulard touchpoints using build phase. → Zoom, or even Slack channels can also help!

💁 Standups are  NOT the only places to resolve blockers. You can raise it DMs also!

### Intelligent Router
