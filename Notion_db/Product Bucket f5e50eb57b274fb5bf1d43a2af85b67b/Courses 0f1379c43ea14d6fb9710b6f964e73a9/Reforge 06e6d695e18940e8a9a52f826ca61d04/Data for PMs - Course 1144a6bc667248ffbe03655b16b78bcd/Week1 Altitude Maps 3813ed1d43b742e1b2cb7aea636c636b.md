## Building the Right Altitude

Quantitative map of the product area we own.

1. **Identifying the Altitudes**
    1. Product line
    2. Product Areas Break down Product Areas with product line within discreet units

Output metrics â†’ Acquiring, retention & monetisation

Acquisition â†’ volume & quality ()

Retention â†’ Retention, engagement metrics

Monetisation â†’ Recurring revenue (Breadth â†’ number of paying customers, Depth - dollars per user)

Other important metrics â†’ TAM, GMV, etc

Example - BrowserStack Altitude Map

- BrowserStack
- App Automate â†’
    - Onboarding & Integrations
    - Platform â†’ Conversion (deal blockers we are getting),Engagement (MAU), Customer advocacy (NPS, Support Experience)
- What is the product area?
    - Target Audience
        - Description â†’ qualitative audience â†’ product use case, demographics, levels of engagement, levels of engagement, etc
        - Size â†’ Target audience / overall user base
        - Segments within target audience â†’ 1-3 types of segmentation (geographic, paid vs non-paid, browser type, level of engagement, acquisition source, etc)
- How does my work create value for end users?
    - Problem description â†’
    - Core actions â†’ What 2-5 core actions that show value is being created for the user
- Value for the business

**Altitude Scorecard**

Wrong Metrics

- Over-optimising on a single north star metric
- Vanity metrics â†’
- Solution-level metrics â†’

Top 3-5 metrics that matter (Retention, Activation, Engagement)

- Adoption â†’ how well we surface and how users are adopting the feature (active adopted users/active target users)
- Retention â†’
- Engagement â†’ **Frequently** users are engaging with our product area, **depth** of engagement, **breadth**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Metrics that strongly indicates userâ€™s needs

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ A set of actionable key outcome metrics so we can hang our hats ons!!

**Personal Space**

Altitude scorecard

Line â†’ App Automate

Product Area â†’ AA Platform (**Fragmentation**, **App Coverage**, **Appâ€™s use case coverage**, Test frameworks coverage - Appium, Testing type coverage - functional testing, **Debugging features,** **Stability, Performance**)

- Engagement â†’ Monthly Active users, number of tests per active user per month
    - Numbers of device-os combinations tested per active user per month, apps uploaded per month
- Customer Experience â†’ NPS
- Retention â†’ Monthly retention â†’ LTM retention
- Stability â†’ ?
- Performance â†’ ?

### Introduction to using Altitude map

Altitude maps â†’ Metrics

### Solution Scorecard

- We can build a solution scorecard but how to effectively evaluating success of our bets?
    - Failure to identify best performance metrics
    - Missing the right data to measure our metrics
    - Lack an effective system for measuring the performance of features we own
- Understanding what to do next â†’ double down, expand audience, pivot

---

### Defining the solution space

Poorly Defined bets

- Feature with no obvious user â†’ Dropbox Paper
- Feature that has already reached max impact â†’ Msft word

**Solution Space**

- MECE â†’ Solutions shouldnâ€™t overlap i.e. multiple solutions aimed at solving the same problem.
- Break down product area into 3 solutions

**Map Solution Space**

Qualitative Solution Description

- Solution itself â†’ Define the feature
- Target population â†’ Size of the target audience in active user base
- Business Value â†’
- User Value â†’ Frequency (how often user faces this problem), severity (how severe it is), and core actions (users are receiving value)
- We should be able to say that â†’ This solution leads to X impact on the altitude scorecard â†’ Y impact on supervisor scorecard â†’ Z impact on the business

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Bets that we own!!

</aside>

**Building Solution Scorecard**

- Key Metric â†’ Solution performance
- Target â†’ for these metrics

Adoption â†’ what share of intended users start using the solution

Retention â†’ 

User value proxy â†’  Engagement metrics (deeper engagement with the product can indicate value being delivered) or Satisfaction score (NPS, CSAT, CES). <Proxy metric that shows users are successful> 

Altitude scorecard success metric â†’ What outcome do we expect this solution to deliver relative to our altitude scorecard? (Engagement)

Supervisor scorecard success metric â†’ L1 metrics (Retention, Monetisation, NPS)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ High problem severity â†’ 80% adoption, 60%, 30-40% 
Retention â†’ 50% retention which adjacent to core product use case, 30% that is less central to core product case

</aside>

**Recognizing Local and Global Maxima**

- Relying on intuition + Using Data to prove

---

### Determining where to go next

Company roadmaps

- Short-term sprint planning
- Medium term roadmapping
- Annual large-scale projects

**Planning the path forward**

- Press pause and objectively evaluate our own product performance
- Strategically plan the path forward to maximise our impact and potential for success
- Communicate in a way that builds alignment

**Press pause and objectively evaluate our own product performance**

- Bottom up approach â†’ Individual Solution Scorecard to evaluate performance
- Where is the biggest opportunity for improvement across my solutions?
- Hitting dead end or experiencing diminishing returns
- Other opportunities or potential solutions that could deliver more impact on product area
- Move upwards â†’ Have solutions made the expected impact

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ PMs job â†’ Maximise market impact towards the companyâ€™s goals! What is the best investment or our teamâ€™s efforts

</aside>

**Strategically plan the path forward to maximise our impact and potential for success**

- Can we improve the solution to create meaningful impact?. If highly adopted, highly retained and highly satisfied feature â†’ focus adoption and monetisation
- Define new solutions within product area â†’ We have reached local maxima and dead end with diminishing returns
- Solutions consistently underperform. Consider redefining the solution space!! (existing solutions give diminishing returns). (similar problem, new audience), (same audience, different user problem) (Expand PM altitude within manager altitude)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Good PMs â†’ Always keep larger business goals in the purview!!

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Winning bets â†’ Career growth!!

</aside>

### In Class Experience

What drives value? â†’ what is amazing, What people care about? What can be done better?

PM Goal â†’ business & user value with limited Engg resources

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ There is always to do. What do you say no to? Say yes what is working for your user and company. PMing is all about bets!!

</aside>

**Case** â†’ A new PM joins in the middle of the year change but is not going anywhere

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Focus back on the core capabilities. Make it really amazing!!

</aside>

Hyopothetical leading metric â†’ which is to my lagging metric â†’ managerâ€™s lagging metric
