## Revision

**Plan**

1. Identify the metrics to drive impact → Tool (Altitude map). 

[Altitude Map](Data%20for%20PMs%20-%20Course%201144a6bc667248ffbe03655b16b78bcd/Altitude%20Map%20045c9c58a96141adaf65efb774d08e71.md)

1. Instrumentation → Do we have the product centric instrumentation
2. Insight generation loop → Develop conjectures, perform analysis and pressure test findings
3. Strong analytical skills → Segmentation analysis & understanding relationship between variables
4. Communicate effectively with data
5. Leverage Data Resources
