### Scrum

- Scrum breaks projects up into tasks that are completable on their own, and then assigns each a "sprint" - to ship that phase of the project.
- Srum requires a reassessment - and potential project changes at the end of each sprint
- It divides responsibility into 3 roles - PO, scrum master and the team
- PO - make sure everything aligns with business goals, and customer needs with a mile-high view of the overall project
- Scrum Master - make sure the team is on track in each individual sprint
- Scrum revolves around 5 meetings
    - Backlog refinement meeting  or backlog grooming - look at left over tasks and define what to pickup. PO prioritizes tasks
    - Sprint Planning Meeting - Once the PO decides what to focus on, this meeting helps the team understand what they will be building and why. User stories needs to be shared.
    - Daily Scrum meetings
    - Sprint Review - will share what they have completed with all the stakeholders
    - Sprint Retrospective - collaborative feedback.  everyone decides what is working and what isn't working
- 

### Kanban

- there 4 pillars of the Kanban philosophy that can help make sure projects get shipped. These include:
    - Cards - Each task has a card
    - Cap on work in progress - limit how many cards are in play at once
    - Continuous Flow - move down the list of backlogs in matter of importance
    - Constant improvement
