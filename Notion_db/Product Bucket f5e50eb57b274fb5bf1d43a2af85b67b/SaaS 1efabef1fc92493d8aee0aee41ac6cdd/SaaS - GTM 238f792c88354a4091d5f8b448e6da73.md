**Work Backwards**

- Who is the customer
- What is the customer problem
- What is the most important benefit
- How do we know that customer wants this
- What does the customer experience look like

You have to ensure feature is  

- Valuable for the customers so they adopt
- Usable  - experience is good
- Feasible - Technically feasible to build and distribution channel to reach the customer

How to think about a new feature

- Company goal
- Stage at which company
- Think of multiple hypotheses
- Feature could have one of these problems
    - Discovery - awareness, are users able to find the feature and understand the value proposition ( Focus the message on what your users can achieve )
    - Value proposition of the feature is not good not for users to adopt it (are people using the feature?)
    - Are they using it in the natural frequency of the problem
    - How to use the feature is too confusing or bad UX wise or the feature is unstable
    - Feature is not good enough among competitors or existing alternatives
    - Product is not good enough to increase metric you want to
- Feature with low adoption, you have 4 choices
    - Kill it
    - More people use it - Increase the % of users adoption, make it possible for more people
    - People use more often - Increase the usage frequency, (make it possible in more situations)
    - It could become quantifiably better for those who use it - feature's experience become much better (take out steps)

- Will everyone see and understand it? - Discoverability with understanding of value addition
- Are you showing users what you did or What they can do? - Focus the message on what your users can achieve.
- Are you announcing it in context? - The right time to promote an improvement is when someone is in your product in a position to use it i.e. an in-app announcement that is triggered according to rules and events.
