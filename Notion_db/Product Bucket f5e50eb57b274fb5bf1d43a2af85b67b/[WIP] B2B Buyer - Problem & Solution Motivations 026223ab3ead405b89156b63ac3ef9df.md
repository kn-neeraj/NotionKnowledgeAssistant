### What are you really trying to say :

Was reading this G2 B2B Software Buyer behaviour 2023 report, sparked some thoughts on my mistakes & learnings from interviewing 100s users & buyers and how to navigate these interviews to find real opportunities.

Usually, the intention of interviews is to explore the problem space or the solution space. In this article, I share learnings from both.

Problem space

1. Understanding the real source of motivation & triggers to solve the problem within the organisation
    1. Prevent the “focusing illusion” by anchoring on the problem too early.  “Nothing is as important as it actually is, while you are talking about it.”. In any interview if you keep hammering at the problem it forces the interviewee to unnaturally focus on the problem however, in their grand scheme of things it might not be a concern!
    2. Understanding the background. How is their professional day to day look like! Where does this even arise! Part of their functional job, something their manager/org has prioritised lately, or makes them stand/out  in front of their manager or org. Note down the subtle cues on the problem makes the entrance! 
    3. What is the trigger now? Why did they get on this call? Was it purely outbound? What has flared up that they are looking for a solution today!
    4. Is this motivation/trigger enduring or a fleeting one? 
    5. When was the last time they faced this problem and what happened? If they did not do anything last time, what has changed now (pressure from the top, customers complaining, key metrics tanking!!)? Note: If customers are not looking for a solution, you have to sell the problem before the solution! Much harder!
    6. The real motivation in any B2B purchases is limited → …..
        1. Improves top line → grows revenue
        - Reduces cost
        - Makes you productive & time-effective
        - Reduces risk
        - Improves quality/experience
        - Strategic growth opportunities
2. Urgency! 
    1. How do you stack-rank this problem in next 6 months? Low, medium, high
    2. Why or why not the problem is higher? 
    3. What happens if they don’t solve this problem today? What will they lose (If not today, maybe it will become a far bigger problem tomorrow!) Have they realised it? Can you paint that picture for them? 
3. Criticality 
    1. If they  don’t solve this problem ever, what happens? If they ineedid not solveed are they seeing any repercussions? 
    2. If they don’t solve it today what happens?
    3. The last time they faced this problem what are the solutions the tried? If nothing, solution isn’t painful enough yet! 
4. Frequency
    1. When was the last time you faced this problem? 
    - How often do they face this problem?  Is it part of their daily routine or a transient one (appears, intensifies, dies down)
    - Can you change this behaviour?

Solution Space

In general, Organisations always want to buy more software, even in downturns, because softwares can automate stuff, cost-effective, and more scalable over time!

From the G2 : 

Parameters driving the B2B purchase behaviour : 

1. More n more ROI from the purchase
2. Time to value from the purchase ~6 months or less
3. Authenticity of the vendor matters! 83% of buyers prefer buying products from the same vendor instead of switching vendors. Multiple vendors add complexity!
4. AI as a foundation layer  
5. Ease of integration & how it works seamlessly with their ecosystem of tools
6. Others → customer support, cost, security, etc

- More n more ROI  & time to value from the purchase
- Buyers prefer to work with sellers whose products they
already use. 83% of buyers prefer buying products from the same vendor
instead of switching vendors. Multiple vendors add complexity!
- Works seamlessely with their existing tools (integrations)
- AI as a foundation layer
- **Value, scalability, and ease of integration → Critical**
- Others → customer support, cost, secure, etc

Make the journey simpler!!

- Organisations have a lot going at their end..beyond the “problem” that you are talking about. Focusing illusion leads to building products that don’t sell or is hard to answer problems like “why should I care about it” “why now….”
- Understanding an Organisation’s (user & buyer) source of motivation, urgency, intensity to solve a problem is really important
- If they don’t solve this problem what are they missing today?
    - If not solved today, Will it become a bigger problem tomorrow? How?
- Don’t fall prey to focusing illusion bias. “Nothing in business is as important as it actually is, while you are talking about it.” In an ideal world, everybody wants to solve every problem! But every org. is resource starved all the time, thats where stack-ranking comes into play based on problem’s outcome being urgent, compelling, and really hitting the business in some way!
- Value proposition of any B2B product is a few!
- Learnings from G2
- What are the questions you can ask to un-earth deeper motivation about the problem

[Introduction]

Was reading the G2 B2B Software Buyer behaviour report and sparked some thoughts on what I have learned from 100s of B2B interviews (both users & buyers), mistakes I have done, on what questions could help us product people to identify “real” opportunities that are worth pursuing!!

[Body]

1. Source of motivation & Preventing the focusing illusion - Anchoring on the problem too early in any interview leads to focusing illusion (Credits Shreyas Doshi). “Nothing is as important as it actually is, while you are talking about it.”. In any interview if you keep hammering at the problem it forces the intervieweee to unnaturally focus on the problem however, in their grand scheme of things it might not be an important problem itself! How to prevent it,  : 
    1. Understand their background. In their professional life, how they go about doing things and take subtle cues on when does this problem even appear! what is the context? (did their manager asked for anything?, is it part of their functional job, is it aspirational (maybe it will help get brownie points for promotion!, makes them look good or something…)
    2. When was the last time they faced this problem and what happened? If they did not do anything last time, what has changed now (pressure from the top, customers complaining, key metrics tanking!!)? Note: If customers are not looking for a solution, you have to sell the problem before the solution! Much harder!
    
2. Urgency! 
    1. How do you stack-rank this problem in next 6 months? Low, medium, high
    2. Why? 
    3. What happens if you don’t solve this problem today? (If not today, maybe it will become a far bigger problem tomorrow!) Have they realised it? Can you paint that picture for them? 

1. Criticality - If they  don’t solve this problem ever, what happens? what is happening now?  What are they getting by solving it? Only few exists in the end : 
    - Improves top line → grows revenue
    - Reduces cost
    - Makes you productive & time-effective
    - Reduces risk
    - Improves quality/experience
    - Strategic growth opportunities

1. Frequency
- How often do they face this problem?
- Is it part of their daily routine or a transient one (appears, intensifies, dies down)
- Can you change this behaviour?

**Buyer journey**

Research → Evaluation → Decision → Implementation in the org

As product persons we interview potential users all the time! Having done 100s of B2B (both users & buyers) interviews and seeing what ideas/features stick and what don’t…jotting down my thoughts 

Having done 100s of B2B interviews (both users & buyers) and seeing what features stick and what simply couldn’t create any impact → Jotting down my thoughts what a lot product people, including me, get wrong while 

In Solution space, buyers typically look for : 

- More n more ROI  & time to value from the purchase
- Buyers prefer to work with sellers whose products they
already use. 83% of buyers prefer buying products from the same vendor
instead of switching vendors. Multiple vendors add complexity!
- Works seamlessely with their existing tools (integrations)
- AI as a foundation layer
- **Value, scalability, and ease of integration → Critical**
- Others → customer support, cost, secure, etc

## G2 B2B Software Buyer Behaviour Report - 2023

1. Spending on software will still increase because of efficiency and accuracy, and productivity! Even during downturns!

But…

**More value from existing purchases**

**Quick Returns on their investments**

- 60% expect ROI in 6 months or less
- The urgency to quickly
demonstrate ROI is even greater in APAC as shorter
contract lengths increase the pressure to show value
within 6 months of purchase

**Balance b/w speed and security**

- 86% of buyer expect a security assessment before purchase
- 24% involve security stakeholder during the research phase
- 14% leave it until implementation

**Favour the incumbent**

Buyers prefer to work with sellers whose products they
already use. 83% of buyers prefer buying products from the same vendor
instead of switching vendors. This is because using multiple vendors to build a
tech stack offers buyers a chance to explore best-of-breed solutions but adds
complexity. It requires managing more contracts and potentially complicates
integration—

**Integrations with existing tools**

 82% of buyers say it’s important for the software they buy to
integrate with tools they already have

**Factors shaping the B2B buyer behaviour**

**BUyers see AI as a foundation to business strategy → more willing to spend!**

- In fact, 81% of respondents say that it is
important or very important that the software they purchase moving forward has
AI functionality
- Legal times will get involved in purchase process Buyers
and vendors have to scrutinize how their own company’s data will be treated and the
risks associated with generative AI output.

### **Value, scalability, and ease are
top considerations for software
buyers**

![Screenshot 2023-06-30 at 8.11.52 PM.png](%5BWIP%5D%20B2B%20Buyer%20-%20Problem%20&%20Solution%20Motivations%20026223ab3ead405b89156b63ac3ef9df/Screenshot_2023-06-30_at_8.11.52_PM.png)

**Buyers prioritize value over cost; regardless of size, buyers are more concerned about
showing value than focusing on software costs or total cost of ownership (TCO).**

---

### Integrations with existing tools

**82% of respondents mention it is important to them that the software they
buy integrates with their existing solutions. Buyers rank ease of integration
higher than the cost of the software, the kind of security it provides, or
its TCO**

Buyers prefer to work with fewer vendors (78%) and use a single
solution instead of multiple tools (84%). When multiple solutions are
required, 77% of buyers prefer to buy complementary products from the
vendors they already work with.

## Richer view of value

Vendors are more frequently employing business value
advisory consultants to learn about and advise on how solutions create business
value over time. More complete assessments include **bottomline cost savings
or risk mitigation, topline business growth examples, and strategic growth
opportunities.**

Buyers are decreasing their reliance on salespeople and gravitating to other
trusted sources of information and self-service. The top 85% of most influential
sources include industry experts, colleagues or professional networks, online
reviews, and other internal influencers.

Vendors must build product awareness across communities, experts, and review
platforms.

### Offer self-service options across multiple channels
throughout the process

Buyers are looking for self-service options at every stage of the buying process.
Enterprise buyers, in particular, want the majority of the software purchase
process to be self service

Buyers may want the majority of the implementation process to be self service
(the importance buyers attribute to ease of implementation, ranked first among
buyer considerations across all respondents, highlights this)

### Help buyers navigate complex security requirements

To accommodate buyers from these verticals and company sizes,
vendors must:
1.Lead with product security credentials
2.Conduct buyer interviews to dive into their security and privacy vetting process
3.Design information or implementation according to buyer needs and resources

## Quality of implementation

93% of respondents say that the quality of the implementation
process has a significant influence on the decision to renew a software product.

If you are a PM or a founder, your product or your features needs to satisfy at least one of these. 

1. Increases Revenue
2. Lowers Cost
3. Saves Time
4. Reduces Risk
4. Improves quality or experience
