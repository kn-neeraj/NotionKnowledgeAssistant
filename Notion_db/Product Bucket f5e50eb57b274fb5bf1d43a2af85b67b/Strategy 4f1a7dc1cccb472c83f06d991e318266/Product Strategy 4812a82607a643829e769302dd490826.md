## **Business Equation**

 [https://venturedesktop.substack.com/p/the-business-equation](https://venturedesktop.substack.com/p/the-business-equation) 

- Each business can be distilled into a simple equation
- A good business equation means 3 straightforward criteria
    - focuses on isolating "controllable high-leverage inputs"
        - focus on inputs because they are controllable, incentivize people to take on higher beta, more difficult tasks, upstream to value delivery
        - Figure out the highest level business equation (eBay = gross merchandise sales * take rate)
        - "working backwards" - (from the impact you want to what could cause it) Go deeper into the high level business equation to figure out the interrelations and impact of an action on its business equation
    - deeply tied to value delivery (user engagement)
        - Example Paypal
            - Trxn revenue = active accounts * engagement * avg. txn value * take rate (engagement is most important)
            - engagement is most important because it an indicator of how much value a customer is deriving out of the platform
        - Example Roku
            - platform revenue = active accounts * streaming hours/account * (CPM / 1000 mins)
            - streaming_hours/account is most important because its a measure of engagement
    - maps directly to company's accumulating advantage
        - Can a company plug a highly engaged set of users into a compounding flywheel that gains momentum and leverage over time?
        - accumulating advantage means a business gets easier over time and means a company has built a defensible moat
- Ex - Peloton Business Equation
    - subscriber * ARPU * Gross margin% * Retention
        - engagement = avg. workout sessions per month connected subscriber

- SaaS plus a box model - use hardware for distribution and build SaaS platform on top of it
- equation - CAC * ARPU * software gross margin% * monthly churn

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Peloton has high annual retention rate (96%). But also look at avg. retention and median retention.  Has high CAC because of the hardware and marketing to get the user. Plus the TAM seems to be low!i

- Growth = Top of the funnel(traffic, conversion rates) * Magic Moment(compelling early experience) * Core Product Value (PMF)
- Growth = market expansion * vertical expansion * merchants/vertical * products per merchant * traffic_to_site/app * page_conversion * increase in avg. ticket size

## **Advantage Flywheels**

- [https://tomtunguz.com/saas-innovators-solution/](https://tomtunguz.com/saas-innovators-solution/)  - SaaS flywheel
    - outbound SMBs and teams within mid-market, enterprises
    - inside enterprise sales teams focuses exclusively on cross sell and up sellmu
- [https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/flywheel-effect-why-positive-feedback-loops-are-a-meta-competitive-advantage-6d0ed55b67c5](https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/flywheel-effect-why-positive-feedback-loops-are-a-meta-competitive-advantage-6d0ed55b67c5)
- [https://futureblind.com/2019/08/03/advantage-flywheels/](https://futureblind.com/2019/08/03/advantage-flywheels/)
    - multiple positive feedback loops when set in motion leads to long term competitive advantage
        - 6 common positive feedback loops
            - **Direct network effect** (demand side economies of scale)- more users, more value for existing users
            - **supply economies of scale** - more suppliers, more volume, lower fixed cost per unit,  lower prices
            - **2 sided network effect** - more users/buyers - more suppliers/developers - better value proposition
            - **switching costs** - customer integrate products, customer lock in, less competition, easier to get new customers
            - **brand habit** -
                - Brand Habit flywheel exhibits the typical loop for habit-reinforcing association of a brand with a specific quality or job-to-be-done
                - strong PM fit - lower searching costs - more frequent purchases
            - **proprietary tech** - higher tech performance - better product - more customers - more experience building(data)

- **Flywheel limiting factors**
    - Switching costs & network effects â€” product quality slips as the incentives to improve arenâ€™t strong when customers canâ€™t leave â†’ value of a competitive offering overcomes switching cost.
    - Learning curve of proprietary tech â€” hitting top of the S-curve, output efficiency declines, and competitors catch up.
    - Direct network effects â€” any source of decreasing value to users, which could cause users to exit and turn the virtuous cycle into a vicious one.

## - **Moats**

- Definition Moats are those barriers that protect your businessâ€™ margins from the erosive forces of competition
- [https://florentcrivello.com/index.php/2018/07/29/mind-the-moat-a-7-powers-review/](https://florentcrivello.com/index.php/2018/07/29/mind-the-moat-a-7-powers-review/)

7 powers which are foundations of business strategy

- **economies of scale** -
    - if you have low marginal costs business it makes sense to have economies of scale. Being #1 pays, especially in those industries with very low marginal costs (like software because building software costs same regardless of the number of people using it, and still sell at a low price)
- **Network effects**
    - Simple Definition - if the experience for your customers gets better as more customers join in - they are different from virality
    - [https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/](https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/)
- **Counter Positioning**
    - Definition - Counter-positioning is the practice of developing your business model such that incumbents have conflicting incentives preventing them to compete effectively
        - disruption could be two-fold - technology and business model (kodak vs digital cameras)
            - digital camera was superior with no need of roll and immediate picture, no roll requirement
            - They made most of their profits selling high-margin camera roll. digital camera had zero margins on camera roll but it could larger addressable markers can make up for lower margins
- **Switching Costs**
    - locking your customer in
    - vendor lock in the reason why enterprise software is such overpriced
        
        Ex  - complex tools, gmail etc
        
        ![Product%20Strategy%204812a82607a643829e769302dd490826/057NePM.png](Product%20Strategy%204812a82607a643829e769302dd490826/057NePM.png)
        
- **Brand**
    - Some of the most powerful brands in the world sell commodities, like Lâ€™Oreal, Louis Vuitton, Diesel, Leviâ€™s, Rolex, etc. This is no coincidence,
    - Brands signal quality
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ To develop a skill, look for lifeforms that had no choice but to excel at it.
    
    </aside>
    
    - **Internet effect** : The Internet demolishes this effect, by connecting a productâ€™s prospective customers with its current ones. Who needs a brand when youâ€™ve got ratings? Breaks information asymmetry
    - Another reason why brands might always be a thing is that the Internet isnâ€™t touching one of their other fundamental functions: signaling the quality
- **Cornered Resource**
    - A company corners a resource when it somehow gains preferential access to it
    - Example - Google AI PhD, Intellectual Property
- **Process Power**
    - process can contribute to product quality

## Aggregation Theory

- The value chain for any given consumer market is divided into three parts - suppliers, distributors and consumers/users
- Best way to outsize profits is to
    - gain a horizontal monopoly in one of the three parts
    - integrate two of the parts such that you have a competitive advantage in delivering vertical solution
- Earlier distributors integrated backwards into supply. In a world where transactions are costly owning the supplier relationship provides significantly more leverage.
- With internet, distribution of digital goods and cost of transaction almost zero, thus for distributors it made sense to integrate forward with end customers at scale. Consumers are first order priority and suppliers are commodomitized
- important determining factors is customer experience. it gets more customers, which gets more suppliers, which further enhances the customer experience
- Examples
    - Google - google made articles, pages directly accessible via search. google integrated search results with search and profile data about users, enabling to sell highly effective advertising
    - Facebook - Facebook allows advertizers to target customers directly
    - Amazon - modularized distribution via e-commerce and e-books. Amazon integrates customer data, payment, book distribution, Amazon publishing initiative,
    - Netflix - integrated content, customer management
    - Uber - integrating dispatch with customer management at worldwide scale
    - Airbnb - integrating property management, enabling it to scale worldwide
- Strong winner take all effects
