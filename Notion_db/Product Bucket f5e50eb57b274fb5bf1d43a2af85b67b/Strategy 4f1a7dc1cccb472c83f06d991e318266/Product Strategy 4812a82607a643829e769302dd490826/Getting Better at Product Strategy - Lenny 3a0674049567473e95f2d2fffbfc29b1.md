# Getting Better at Product Strategy - Lenny

Airbnb

- New users booking requests was getting rejected for like hosts not updating calendars, pets not allowed etc
- We spent many months optimizing the booking flow, focusing on increasing the host acceptance rate — sending more reminders, incentivizing hosts to accept more often and more quickly
- Thought exercise : what would the ideal guest experience look like? If we were to start over, how would we design the Airbnb booking experience?

### Strategy

- A strategy is your plan to win (Whatever you’re trying to achieve. Normally your company, or team, mission)
- **Why do you need a strategy?**
1. To create alignment
2. To create clarity
3. To create focus

1. Mission: What are we trying to achieve?
2. Vision: What does the world look like when we’ve achieved it?
3. **Strategy: How will we achieve it?**
4. Goals: How will we measure our progress towards it?
5. Roadmap: What do we need to build to get there?

### Step 1: Determine your strategy

1. **Problem-oriented**: Clearly identifies the problem
2. **Insight-driven**: Rooted in insights, both quantitative and qualitative
3. **Actionable**: Outlines concrete actions/investments that will solve this problem
4. **Focused**: Has a small number of high-leverage bets
5. **Cohesive**: Create a clear path from the problem to the solution

### **Guides to developing your own strategy**

When developing your own product strategy, these are the best three guides I’ve come across:

### Step 2: Articulating your strategy

### **Qualities of well-articulated strategy**

1. Short
2. Memorable
3. Is explained with framework or a metaphor
4. Leverages the [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)#:~:text=The%20rule%20of%20three%20is,or%20effective%20than%20other%20numbers.&text=The%20Latin%20phrase%20%22omne%20trium,as%20the%20rule%20of%20three.)
5. Is easy to find (and share)

### Organizing your strategy

I usually start with this company strategy template or a team strategy template, and then roughly follow The Minto Pyramid Principle:

1. What is the current situation?
2. What is the complication?
3. What is the solution?
4. How do we achieve this solution?

### Step 3: Acting on your strategy

“A good strategy is, in the end, a hypothesis about what will work.”

1. **Remind people over and over**: Don’t expect anyone to remember any part of the strategy. Remind your team, and stakeholders, at every opportunity — every all-hands, every update email, every review meeting.
2. **All prioritization should go through your strategy**: One of the main goals of a strategy is to create focus — to know what NOT to do. Continue to return to it when making prioritization decisions.
3. **Be ready to evolve it:** Sometimes you’ll be wrong, or you’ll learn something new that requires adjusting your plans. Don’t be sad. Learn from it, adjust it, and keep moving forward.
