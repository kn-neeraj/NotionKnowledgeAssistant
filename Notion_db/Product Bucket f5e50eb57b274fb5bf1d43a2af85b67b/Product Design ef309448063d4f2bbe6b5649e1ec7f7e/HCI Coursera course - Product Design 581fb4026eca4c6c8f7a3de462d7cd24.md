# HCI Coursera course - Product Design

## Coursera HCI course - Design implement and evaluate designs

design fundamentals,

implement

evaluation

### Week1

Human Computer Interaction

Power of prototyping

- Enables designers to test their hypothesis
- feedback and iteration
- Audience - colleagues, clients, users, yourselves
- Have a goal - iterate designs to fit the goal (instead of arguing about one design)
- Jee Hawkins (Palm designer) carrying around a wood prototype of how the Palm would look like
- It should not be required to complete, easy to change, gets to retire
- Prototypes should be give you new knowledge or new problems (otherwise they are wasting your time)
- Rapid exploration
- Prototypes are questions!

Evaluating Designs of people

- Usability studies - watch someone use my interface
    - Shortcoming - not ecologically(environment) valid, the know they are trying out user interface,
- Surveys
- Focus Groups - group of people discussing, bad for taboo topics etc
- Feedback from experts
    - peer critique, dogfood, heuristic evaluation - structured feedback
- Comparative experiments
    - which option is more effective
- Participant observation
    - observing what people actually do in the environments they will use the product
- Simulations and formal models
- Issues to consider
    - Reliability/Precision
    - Generalizability
    - Realism
    - Comparison
    - Work Involved
    
    History - Major innovations
    
    - GUI - IO make it more intuitive and direct
    - Mouse and Hypertext -
        - Xerox - first GUI operating system (Alan Kay), prototypes Dynabook

    ðŸ’¡ Good idea/products are very clunky early one

## Week2 - Needfinding

- Participant observation
    - Tacit knowledge - deep hanging out
    - Fieldwork
        - What do people now?
        - What values and goals do people have?
        - what are similarities and differences among people
        - Always look for hacks/errors - great way to look for design intervention strategies
        - What people say and what people do is very different!!!!! - ALWAYS OBSERVE WHAT PEOPLE DO
    - Interviewing
        - Choosing participants - representative of target users, current users of similar system, might also be the non-users (what are their barriers, what are their goals)
        - For example lecture support system - teachers, children, parents, support staff etc, domestic, international, specially-abled people
        - Recruiting participants - diverse stake of stakeholders, use incentives and motivation, approx. better than nothing
        - if low on money - offer appreciation, gift certificate etc
        - Approximate if necessary!!
        - Early on - Open ended questions!!!
        - Ask people about their lives they own goals
        - Silence is golden!!! people will tell 2nd story! often more interesting than the first one!
        - Diary studies - let people fill diaries for some period of time
        - Experience sampling
            - reminded with pagers/notifications
            - wireless sensor networks
        - Extreme users
        - Keep users in mind for whom you are designing
        - Create personas - abstract users from real users (model of users) - demographics, goals, beliefs, intentions, behaviors - give them a name, occupation, background, social situation
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ Importance of being curious!!! (There is always to be found!!) The more mundane the domain the more creative you need to be!
    
    </aside>
    
    **Create Design Goals**
    
    - If we change the environment, we change the behavior
    - What matters in the design - what larger task it is trying to achieve and for whom
    - **Activity Analysis**
        - **What are the steps (workflows!), artifacts (objects), what are the goals (how you will measure success) and pain points (look for workarounds!)**
        - Products should be have similar workflows because they will be easy to adopt otherwise they have to be FAR BETTER!!
        - Workflows - doing taxes, travel planning etc
        - Artifacts - will have lot of activities
        

## Week3

Storyboards, Paper prototypes, and Mockups

- Use stage appropriate tools

**Storyboarding**

- about conveying the idea - is this the right idea?
- should show - people involved, environment, task being illustrated
    - basic cartooning skills

Paper prototypes

- work fast and make reusable components
- Test multiple options
- Emphasis on conversation
- get users and other stakeholders to help design

Low fidelity mockups

High fidelity mockups

**How to test rapid prototypes with users**

- wizard of oz (basic interface that works like actual)
- feedback - think aloud, retrospective, heuristic evaluation
- identify bugs early on - iterate and fail fast

**Video Prototyping - Wendy Mackay's materials**

- Cheap and fast
- Great communication tools
- Can serve as a spec for developers
- need - realistic location

## week 4 - Heuristic Evaluation

**Heuristic Evaluation**

- Critique - heurisitc feedback
- peer critique
- When to get design critique
    - before user testing
    - before redesigning
    - when you know there are problems, but your need evidence
    - before release
- Begin review with a clear goal
- Heuristic evaluation by jakob nielsen - helps find usability problems in a design
- Small set of evaluators examine UI
    - independently check for compliance with usability principles
    - different evaluators will find different problems
    - findings are aggregated
- Can perform on working UI or sketches

**Phases of Heuristic Evaluation**

- Pre-evaluation training - give evaluators needed domain knowledge and information on the scenario
- Evaluation - evaluate and aggregate results
- Severity rating -  has - frequency, impact and persistence, prioritise
- Debriefing - review with design team
- at least two passes for each evaluator - feel for flow and scope of system, second to focus on specific problems
- Feedback - issue, severity heuristic it violated, description
- Debriefing - design, dev team members
- 10 heuristics
    - UNDERSTANDING
        - Consistency - keep words, design, dialog consistent across the product
        - Use familiar metaphors & language - words, phrases and concepts understandable for the generic user
        - clean & functional design - "form follows function"
    - ACTION
        - User control and Freedom - things that happen all the time - leave the doors wide open, things user can do
        - Flexibility - "Good defaults and options", collaborative filtering or recommender systems (algo must be good),
        - Recognition over recall - important, it should be clear from the visual what user will accomplish, enough context, good previews - icons, thumbnails helps
    - PROVIDE USERS GOOD FEEDBACK (how do you know what happened - user feedback)
        - Show status/state - show the current state (outcome, loading, progress bar, countdown etc), where you are and what next step will be
        - Prevent Errors - prevent bad data,
        - Support Error Recovery - "Don't give random error messages!! NO NO NO!!",
        - Provide Help - provide useful help, show examples/common ways, can contain tutorials,
