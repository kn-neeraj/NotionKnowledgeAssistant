Developing products that resonate with people are about two things - 

1) understanding peopleâ€™s desires, and 2) understanding how people react to things.

- **How did this app come to your attention?** - Was it word of mouth from a friend? Interesting. Whyâ€™d she tell you about it? Or did you read about this app in an article? If so, what compelled you to actually go find it and download it? Was it recommended? Did it have a catchy icon and an intriguing name? Had you heard it about it before, and if so, how many times before? Why didnâ€™t you download it then, and what eventually tipped you over towards trying it out now?
- W**hatâ€™s your one-line summary of what this app does at this stage?** - Itâ€™s interesting to compare the answer to this question before using the app and after.
- **Whatâ€™s the buzz so far?** Do you have a sense of whether itâ€™s popular? Whether itâ€™s useful? Slick? Next-level? Did you happen to glance at the ratings, reviews, and description as you were downloading the app?

Spend time with the app as you normally do -

1. **Whatâ€™s the experience of getting started or signing up?**Â Was it easy, with just a few button taps, or was it challenging with a bunch of verification steps?
2. **How does this app explain itself in the first minute?**Â Was it clear about what it did and how it works? Did the messaging feel friendly? Confusing? Did you read and retain the information, or did you skip it because it felt long-winded and boring?
3. **How easy to use was the app?**Â Did you understand immediately what the app was about, or did you need to tap around to try things and figure it out? Are there a lot of navigational items and buttons and gizmos to process, or did the entire thing feel familiar, contained and simple?
4. **How did you feel while exploring the app?**Â Did a cute illustration, funny quip, or piece of really interesting content make you smile? Did the navigation frustrate you because you couldnâ€™t figure out how to get back to a previous screen? Did you feel smarter and more efficient for using this app? Did you take note of a particular detail and thinkÂ *Wow, Iâ€™ve never seen that before?*
5. **Did the app deliver on your expectations**? Looking back to what you thought the app would do, did it match your experience of actually using it? If itâ€™s a content app, was the content engaging? If itâ€™s a utility app, did it solve the identified problem in a meaningful manner?
6. **How long did you spend using the app**? Time generally correlates with interest. If you spent a long time on the app, what about it kept you using it?

Broad questions of stickiness and growth after using it for days and weeks

1. **How often have you used the app? When do you tend to use it? What compels you to open it?**Â Is it because of enticing push notifications? Or because all your friends are still talking about and using it? Is it because youâ€™ve found yourself relying on it again and again? Has this app transcended all obstacles to achieve the esteemed goal of becoming a regular habit in your life? Why or why not?
2. **How does this app compare to other similar apps?**Â Which things does it do better or worse? What would make you choose to use this app versus something similar?
3. **What do other people think of this app?**Â Getting additional perspectives is one of the quickest ways to learn about what works and what doesnâ€™t in the broader market. Read reviews. Read comments in blogs. Read tweets about this app. Ask your friends what they think. Ask your cousins who live in a different town from you. Does their impression match yours? In what ways is it different, and why do you think itâ€™s different?
4. **Based on all that you know, how successful do you think the app will be a year from now?**Â Take a real stance. Write it down in a digital sticky note somewhere. It can be private. You donâ€™t have to shout it out to the world. But capturing a clear and honest bet so that you can go back and look to see if you were right or wrong is one of the most objective ways to combatÂ [hindsight bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias).
5. (**And eventually, after enough time has passed),**Â **were you right in your prediction of how this app was going to do?**Â If not, why not? How were your own personal preferences and tastes similar or different from people in the broader market? YouÂ *must*Â understand this in order to better calibrate your opinions in the future.
