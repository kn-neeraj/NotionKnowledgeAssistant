# Managing up

**Over-communicate**: Consistently share what you plan to do, what you’re doing, and what you did. It’s nearly impossible to over-communicate. I started sending a weekly “State of Me” email to my boss, with (1) things they can help me with, (2) my current priorities, and (3) things on my mind. It worked wonders.

"State of me" mail :

1. Product priorities of the week → Product priorities, 
2. Ops & others → (deal blockers, customer calls, <anything else to highlight>)
3. Need help from manager : <>

**Set expectations**: When taking on work, set realistic expectations around time, resources needed, and quality. Your performance will be judged based on how it compared to your manager’s expectations. Be ambitious, but also be realistic.

**Share the trade-offs:** When asked to make changes to a plan, be transparent about the trade-offs. Don’t assume they know what you know. What will suffer? What will benefit? What do you recommend? Partner with your manager to make the best decision.

**Prioritize and communicate:** When asked to take on additional work, particularly last minutes, prioritize it amongst your existing priorities and share your updated priorities with your manager. Ask them if they disagree — adjust if so.

**Do great work:** The better you do -> the more your manager will trust you -> the more freedom and influence you will have. If you feel micro-managed, and others around you don’t, it’s likely because you aren’t performing well. Do great work and life will get better.

If something is FYI, mention it.
